What is McIDAS-V?
McIDAS-V is a free, open source, visualization and data analysis software package that is the next generation in SSEC's 35-year history of
sophisticated McIDAS software packages. McIDAS-V displays weather satellite (including hyperspectral) and other geophysical data in 2- and 3dimensions. McIDAS-V can also analyze and manipulate the data with its powerful mathematical functions. McIDAS-V is built on SSEC's
VisAD and Unidata's IDV libraries, and contains "Bridge" software that enables McIDAS-X users to run their commands and tasks in the
McIDAS-V environment, and an integrated version of SSEC's HYDRA software package.

Image 1: The McIDAS-V main display window.
This McIDAS-V User's Guide is currently under construction. Once completed, it will describe using the features available in the McIDAS-V
application. For a brief description about getting started using McIDAS-V and making displays of common data available, refer to the Getting
Started section.
This Guide was originally developed at the Unidata Program Center by the developers of the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV). The first version of
the McIDAS-V User's Guide was created from the IDV User's Guide (September 2007) and has since been updated to reflect the changes that
have been made to McIDAS-V, IDV, and VisAD (see the Release Notes for details on recent changes).
Development of McIDAS-V is ongoing at the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The
development is driven by the needs of the community of users. Suggestions, comments, and collaboration are welcomed and encouraged. See
Documentation and Support for more information. The goal is to provide new and innovative ways of displaying and analyzing Earth science data,
as well as provide common displays that many of its users have come to expect.

How can I get McIDAS-V?
See Downloading and Running McIDAS-V for information on how to download McIDAS-V, install McIDAS-V, and run McIDAS-V. For
additional information, refer to the latest McIDAS-V training materials.

System Requirements
McIDAS-V should run on any platform that fully supports Java and Java 3D. It has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows .
AIX and IRIX support the requirements in certain configurations, but have not been tested.
It is recommended that an Intel system running McIDAS-V have at least a 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB memory (RAM). Please note that Java
on 32 bit operating systems can only utilize 1536 MB, while 64 bit operating systems can utilize all of the available memory. Performance will be
better with faster processors and more memory.
Detailed requirements for the following are listed below:
Operating Systems
Graphics Cards
Java Versions
System Memory and Processor Speed
Internet Connection for Downloading McIDAS-V and Accessing Data

Operating Systems
McIDAS-V is known to run on the following operating systems:
OS
Linux
Mac OS X
Solaris
Windows

Tested at SSEC (1)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4.0 (32 bit)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 5.0 (64 bit)
Mac OS X 10.6(2)
Solaris 10 OS (x86 and SPARC) Platform Edition
Windows XP with Service Pack 3
Windows Vista with Service Pack 2

NOTE:
(1) The local ADDE servers are distributed as binaries compiled only on these Operating System versions. If you are running versions
other than those listed, the local ADDE servers may not work and give you an error message that the "Local Server is not running".
(2) Due to changes in the requirements of the netCDF package, McIDAS-V requires Java 1.6. Some Mac OS X systems do not support
Java 1.6 and thus are unable to run McIDAS-V. These include:
- All with PPC processors
- Intel Core Solo and Core Duo running OS X 10.5 or earlier

Graphics Cards
McIDAS-V works on systems with graphics cards that support OpenGL (all systems) and Direct-X (version 8.0+, Windows only). On Linux, the
driver must support GLX, an X windows system extension to OpenGL programs. McIDAS-V also works on systems with stereo video cards. If
you are purchasing a new system, we have seen the best results with NVIDIA hardware and drivers.
McIDAS-V utilizes the latest developments in Java3D programming and video driver updates. If you encounter any problems with system
instability (such as using all of the memory or CPU on your machine, or frequent software crashes) or unusual data displays with "torn" or "gray"
images, you should make sure you have the latest video driver for your system . Even if the system is brand new, the video driver may not be the
most recent version available.
Please Note: We have found that Lenovo products with the GM965 chipset running Windows are not compatible with Java3D and
thus will not work with McIDAS-V. Other Intel chipsets such as the GMA950 are known to work.
To determine the brand and driver information of your graphics card, follow the guides for each platform below:
Windows
From the Start menu click on Control Panel (click Start->Settings->Control Panel if you have the Classic Start menu), select
Appearance and Themes and double click on Displays (double click on Displays if you have the Classic Control Panel menu). The
graphics card brand and driver information will be under the Adaptor tab.
Linux
Open a command terminal and type the following command "lspci -v". The graphics card information will be listed under "VGA
compatable controller".
Mac OS X
Open the Apple menu and select "About This Mac". Click on the "More Info..." button to open up the System Profiler. Click on
"Graphics/Displays" under the Hardware list on the left hand side.
Once you have determined your graphics card brand and driver information, check the manufacturers web page for information on their updated
versions. Here are links to some of the most common graphic card Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM):

The necessary versions of the JRE, Java3D and JOGL are included with the Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows installers. On other
platforms, you will need to install Java and Java3D before installing McIDAS-V. If other platforms fully support Java version 1.6+ and Java 3D
version 1.3.1+ (e.g. AIX, IRIX), they should also work, but have not been tested.
NOTES:
(1) The version of the Mesa library that comes with Red Hat Linux may be incompatible with Java 3D packaged with McIDAS-V. If
you experience X server crashes when exiting McIDAS-V, you will need to build and install Mesa from source available at
http://www.mesa3d.org .
(2) To find and/or update your default Java version, follow these steps:
1. Open the "Java Preferences" application located in /Applications/Utilities
2. Look for "Java SE 6" in the "Java Applications" section
3. The version at the top of the "Java Applications" list is the version being used by McIDAS-V. If "Java SE 6" is not at the top of
the list, click and drag it to the top of the list (using the 64-bit option, if available). If "Java SE 6" is not in the "Java
Applications" list, you may need to manually run the Software Update feature in the Apple Menu.
(3) OpenGL

must be installed for Java 3D to run on Solaris.
must have DirectX version 8.0+ installed on your Windows system if you use the DirectX rendering mode of Java 3D (the
default is to use OpenGL).
(4) You

System Memory and Processor Speed
McIDAS-V can be demanding of hardware speed and memory depending on the size of the datasets you wish to work with. It is recommended
that the system have a minimum of 512 MB of RAM free for McIDAS-V use. Performance is significantly better with 1 GB RAM or more.
Please note that 32 bit Java Runtime Environments (JRE) can utilize a maximum of 1536 MB RAM, while 64 bit JREs can utilize all of the RAM
available to the operating system (64 bit OS required).
The recommended processor speed will vary by platform. You can run on a system as slow as 500 MHz or even less, but response will be
correspondingly reduced. In general, the faster the processor, and the more memory your system has, the better the performance will be.
For reasonable performance, it is recommended that an Intel system running McIDAS-V have at least a 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB memory
(RAM). Performance will be even better with faster processors and more memory.

Internet Connection for Downloading McIDAS-V and Accessing Data
You will need about 100 MB disk space for the installer file, which will uncompress into twice that size. You will have to download the installer
file in order to begin installing McIDAS-V.
McIDAS-V is designed to access data on remote servers on the Internet, as well as from local files. Downloading data from remote servers
benefits from a fast connection to the Internet, since many data fields are large.

Downloading and Running McIDAS-V
Note: McIDAS-X users who install McIDAS-V and want to run their McIDAS-X commands in the McIDAS-V environment via the Bridge must
also be running McIDAS-X version 2007a or greater. Sites that have joined the McIDAS Users' Group and purchased McIDAS-X support can

Remote Data Servers
Extensive meteorological and oceanographic data is available from remote data servers for use in research and education. Some of these data have
restrictions on their use, see here for that information.
Abstract Data Distribution Environment (ADDE)
Most of the data choosers in McIDAS-V use ADDE as the access method (satellite imagery, Level III radar, surface, profiler and RAOB). The
ADDE choosers are pre-configured with a list of available servers. SSEC and the Unidata community each maintain a set of cooperating ADDE
servers which serve up real-time and archived atmospheric datasets for use in McIDAS-V. You can use any of these to access the near-realtime
data. For more information on accessing data on ADDE servers, see the Choosing Data Sources section.
SSEC image data sets include:
chinook.ssec.wisc.edu
NPRT: Aqua and Terra Arctic composites and granules.
SPRT: Aqua and Terra Antarctic composites and granules.
rets1.ssec.wisc.edu
CIMSSP1: GOES East and West Cloud mask, imager CTP and ECA, and sounder products.
rets2.ssec.wisc.edu
CIMSSP2: GOES NH and SH wildfire products and GOES sounder products.
rets3.ssec.wisc.edu
CIMSSP3: GOES East and West products (CAPE, LI, TPW, Eff Cld, Ctop Pr).

Additional image data sets:
adde.ucar.edu*
RTIMAGES : GOES East and West images in native view, not remapped. Also some global Mollweide images, and an Antarctic
composite.
GINIEAST : GOES East images, remapped to conic, Mercator (cylindrical equidistant), or polar projections channel 1.
GINIWEST:GOES West images, remapped to conic, Mercator (cylindrical equidistant), or polar projections channel 2.
GINICOMP : GINIEAST AND GINIWEST composites.
CIMSS: products derived from one or more channels, made by CIMSS, SSEC.
NEXRCOMP : composites of NEXRAD imagery (1km, 6km, 10 km radar coded message, 1-hour precip total, storm total precip).
goessouth.unidata.ucar.edu
SOUTH : GOES South (GOES-10) imager and sounder coverage of South America.
nanuk.eosdis.nasa.gov
NANUK: Aqua and Terra 1km, 500m, and 250m resolution images.
satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov
PUB: FY2C, METEOSAT-9 (6-hourly) and MTSAT imagery. GOES-East and West imagery and products.
You can configure defaults for particular images by creating a custom defaults file. For more information, see Configuring Image Defaults .
*Additional alternate servers include: adde.cise-nsf.gov, idd.unl.edu, stratus.al.noaa.gov, twister.millersville.edu, weather2.admin.niu.edu, and
weather3.admin.niu.edu. These alternate servers have most or all of the datasets listed under adde.ucar.edu.
THREDDS Data Server (TDS)/OPeNDAP
McIDAS-V can access gridded data (netCDF/GRIB/GEMPAK) and NEXRAD radar data stored on a THREDDS Data Server (TDS) through the
OPeNDAP (formerly called DODS) protocol. See Choosing a Cataloged Data for more information.
HTTP
Many of the data sources listed in the table above can read files directly from web servers (e.g. Apache) through the HTTP protocol. In most
cases, the server must support the HTTP 1.1 protocol and be configured to set the "Content-Length" and "Accept-Ranges: bytes" headers. See the
Choose a URL for more information.

netCDF files
The Network Common Data Form ( netCDF) provides a common data access method for Unidata applications. This format can be used to store a
variety of data types that encompass single-point observations, time series, regular grids, and satellite and radar images. The mere use of netCDF
by itself is not sufficient to make data "self-describing" and meaningful to McIDAS-V.
Generally, McIDAS-V requires that datasets in netCDF format use meta data conventions to be able to fully understand and geolocate the dataset.
These conventions provide documented "best practices" . Using conventions with netCDF ensures your data is complete and self-describing, and
can be used by others. We recommend you use CF, COARDS, or NUWG conventions for netCDF data files for McIDAS-V, and be sure to
follow the best practices noted above.

ASCII Text Point Data
McIDAS-V can read point data and trajectories (aircraft tracks) from comma-separated value (CSV) text files. See the documentation on the Text
(ASCII) Point Data Format .

General
Q. What is McIDAS-V?
A. McIDAS-V is a free, open source, visualization and data analysis software package that is the next generation in the Space Science and
Engineering Center's (SSEC) 35-year history of sophisticated McIDAS software packages. McIDAS-V displays weather satellite (including
hyperspectral) and other geophysical data in 2- and 3-dimensions. McIDAS-V can also analyze and manipulate the data with its powerful
mathematical functions. McIDAS-V is built on SSEC's VisAD and Unidata's IDV libraries, and contains "Bridge" software that enables
McIDAS-X users to run their commands and tasks in the McIDAS-V environment, and an integrated version of SSEC's HYDRA software
package.
Q. Is McIDAS-V still under development?
A. Development of McIDAS-V is ongoing at SSEC and as it progresses new features will be added and any problems/bugs will be fixed. The
development will be driven by the needs of the community of users. Suggestions, comments and collaboration are welcomed and encouraged.
The goal is to provide new and innovative ways of displaying and analyzing data, as well as provide the common displays that many users
have come to expect.

Using McIDAS-V
Q. Where are the McIDAS-V files stored on my computer?
A. McIDAS-V files are divided into two categories: "system files" (supplied files that should not be edited) and "user files" (new user-created
files and supplied ones that contain user settings and preferences). By default, the system files are stored in a directory named McIDAS-VSystem and the user files are stored in a directory named McIDAS-V. The system file directory can be changed during installation and its
location defaults to the OS application directory (e.g., C:\Program Files on Windows, /Applications on OS X). The user file directory is
created in the user's document directory (e.g., C:\Documents and Settings\user \ on Windows, /Users/ user /Documents on OS X, /home/ user
on Linux).
Q. How can I tell if McIDAS-V is busy doing something?
A. The lower right corner of the main McIDAS-V window shows a box with progress bars if McIDAS-V is busy making a display or doing
anything. In the status bar at the bottom, messages will appear when McIDAS-V is reading data from a server or disk. Also, while the displays
are being created, there is usually a "please wait" notice in the lower left corner of the main display.
Q. How can I save a display?
A. McIDAS-V supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF image formats. McIDAS-V can also write out an image and the corresponding Google Earth
KML or KMZ file. Animations can be captured as Quick Time movies or animated GIFs. See Image Captures for more information.
You can save a particular McIDAS-V state with all displays, data sources, maps, map projection, view point, and color tables, by saving a
"bundle" file with the File->Save Bundle. menu, and naming a file. See Saving State with Bundles . A bundle file lets you reset McIDAS-V to
exactly the same state as before. The file can be emailed to others to recreate your McIDAS-V display, provided they have access to the same
data sources.
Using the favorite bundles with File->Save Favorite menu you can save and use several configurations which are retrieved with the Bundles>Favorite Bundles menu.
Q. How can I change the start-up settings?
A. You can customize many of the McIDAS-V properties through Edit->Preferences menu. The preference manager allows you to configure
the many features of McIDAS-V.
You can also create a default McIDAS-V state and save it using the bundle facility. This allows you to override the preferences and also
include datasets and displays to load when McIDAS-V starts. To save a default bundle, use the File->Default Layout->Save menu. See
Saving State with Bundles .

Q. How can I change the amount of memory available to McIDAS-V?
A. By default, McIDAS-V allocates 512 MB of maximum memory for Java. If your system has more than 1 GB of memory, increasing the
amount of memory available to McIDAS-V can improve performance for displaying large datasets. You can change the amount of memory
used by McIDAS-V by editing the Maximum Heap Size in the Advanced tab of the Preferences by selected Edit->Preferences... from the
main menu. Please note that 32 bit Java Runtime Environments (JRE) can utilize a maximum of 1536 MB RAM, while 64 bit JREs can utilize
all of the RAM available to the operating system (64 big OS required). The new amount of memory will be saved and used in subsequent
sessions. Do not use the maximum amount of memory on your machine as some is needed for the operating system itself. If the system has to
use swap memory, performance will degrade as well. See Running McIDAS-V for more information.
Q. How can I have McIDAS-V start with a particular window size and placement?
A. You can save a particular McIDAS-V set-up, so that subsequent sessions start with the same window arrangement and contents. With
McIDAS-V running, move and re-size the display and data source windows to the arrangement you like. Save the "default layout" with the
File->Default Layout->Save menu. The next time you start McIDAS-V the same arrangement will appear.
Q. How can I reset the map projections?
A. This can be controlled with the Projections->Auto-Set Projection menu check-box. When checked on, the map projection will be
automatically switched to match the native projection of the newest data source added. When checked off, the current map projection will
remain for any additional data source added to the display. This may be desirable when you have set up a view of a particular area and want to
retain it when displaying new data.
You can switch an existing display to its native data set projection using the display control's View->Use Data Projection menu.
Q. How can I set the default projection?
A. The default map projection can be set with the Projection Manager which is accessed from the Projections->New/Edit menu. Select one of
the items in the Default pull down list. The default projection is overridden by the projection saved in the default bundle, or by displaying new
data, if the Projections->Auto-Set Projection menu checkbox is checked on. As a result, you may never see the default map projection unless
your default bundle has the default projection, and you have the checkbox checked off. Choosing a default map projection is not necessary for
good use of McIDAS-V and you can ignore it if you like. It is often simpler to use default bundles.
Q. How can I change the color table range?
A. Many displays have a color table controlling the colors of data values. A color table has a range of minimum and maximum data values.
You can change the range for a display by right clicking on the color bar in the display's legend and selecting the Change Range... menu from
the popup menu. For more information on controlling the color table, see the Color Table Editor documentation.
Q. How can I stop McIDAS-V from asking if I really want to exit?
A. Many features of McIDAS-V can be changed though the User Preferences dialog. Use the Edit->Preferences menu to bring up the dialog.
On the General tab, uncheck the "Confirm Before Exiting" box to stop McIDAS-V from asking if you want to exit. Another option is to check
off the "Always Ask" checkbox on the popup dialog box before exiting McIDAS-V.
Q. When I set a color table transparent, why doesn't it show up that way?
A. Using transparency in a color display may give unexpected results. In general, only the last thing added can be fully transparent. If you
have a display that is transparent, then add in a new display, you may not see it. The problem is caused by the lack of ordering in Java 3D.
You can use the display control's View->Bring to Front menu to remove and re-add the display that you want to be transparent so it is last.

Data
Q. What is Fast Rendering and when should I use it?
A. By default, McIDAS-V will try to adjust the data renderings to account for projection seams. This is computationally intensive in some
cases and slows down the display of data. When you set your preference to "Use Fast Rendering", McIDAS-V will not try to account for the
projection seams. If you are displaying data in its native projection, this will result in faster rendering of the data depiction. However, if you
have several displays of data, each from a different data source and on a different projection, you may see anomalies in the displays (spurious
lines, portions of images). At that point, you can turn off fast rendering for a particular display using the Edit->Properties menu of the
Display Control for that display, or set your system preference back to not use fast rendering.
Q. What is the difference between true wind vectors and regular wind vectors?
A. Some gridded data is produced with the wind components being relative to the model grid instead of the earth. The true wind vectors are
rotated from the grid projection to actual (true) wind direction. For non-projected grids (i.e., lat/lon grids), grid relative is the same as true.
Q. What is the difference between the Standard Atmosphere and Vis5D pressure to height conversion?
A. McIDAS-V displays pressure surfaces by converting the pressure to a height in some reference system. There are two reference systems that

come standard with McIDAS-V - the U.S. Standard Atmosphere and Vis5D. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere only computes has conversions
for pressures up to about 80 km. The Vis5D coordinate system uses a logarithmic conversion:
P = 1012.5 * e^( H / -7.2 ) (^ denotes exponentiation) H = -7.2 * Ln( P / 1012.5 ) (Ln
denotes natural log)
so it can be used for heights above 80 km.
Q. Can I view Level III Radar data in McIDAS-V?
A. McIDAS-V can load Level III radar products through the Radar->Level III chooser which connects to an ADDE server. Starting with the
2.0 release, McIDAS-V can read some Level III products from local disk or a THREDDS Data Server (TDS). At present, this is limited to
radial products only.
Q. Can I view Level II Radar data in McIDAS-V?
A. McIDAS-V can load Level II radar products through the Radar->Level II->Remote chooser which connects to an ADDE server. The
Level II data is supplied as volume-scan files, each file having all data from one WSR-88D radar for all sweeps for one "time". Archived
Level II radar files can be displayed through the Radar->Level II->Local file chooser. The files should be stored on your file system with
each station's files in a directory (folder) whose directory name is the station 4-character ID (e.g., KTLX for Oklahoma City). In some cases the
data files do not have any location information in them and McIDAS-V uses the directory name as a first guess at the station location.
Archived Level II data is available from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) .
Q. Why do I get an error when I try to load radar data that I downloaded from NCDC?
A. There are few common problems that can cause this:
1. The files are in a compressed tar file - Typically, when you download Level II data from NCDC, the files are in a compressed TAR
file which holds the individual volume scans. You need to extract the volumes from the TAR file with utilities like tar, gunzip, WinZip
into a directory as described in the previous FAQ item.
2. You are using the Files chooser - You should load the radar data using the Radar->Level II->Local file chooser in the Data Sources
tab of the Data Explorer, not the General->Files chooser. In some cases, the files do not have any location information in them. The
Level II data chooser allows you to associate a station location with the data file, using the directory name as a first guess.
3. You are trying to load Level III raster products - McIDAS-V only handles the Level III data that is stored in radial format (Base
Reflectivity, Storm Relative Velocity, Base Velocity, 1 and 3 hour precipitation, Echo Tops).
Q. When I try to read in my GRIB data, why do I get an ucar.grib.NotSupportedException?
A. For McIDAS-V to read in GRIB data, it needs access to lookup tables for decoding the information in the data. McIDAS-V comes preconfigured with most of the commonly used tables from NCEP, FNMOC, etc, but some GRIB data from regional centers may use tables other
than the defaults. If McIDAS-V does not have the necessary table, you will get the NotSupportedException. You can add in new tables by
following the instructions in the User's Guide section on Adding in new GRIB tables .
Q. How are grids resampled in McIDAS-V?
A. McIDAS-V uses two methods for resampling data - weighted average and nearest neighbor. These are the default sampling modes for
VisAD, which McIDAS-V is based on. For any grid, the samples are organized in a topology, which may be triangles (Irregular2D), squares
(Gridded2D), tetrahedra (Irregular3D) or cubes (Gridded3D). For target points the system finds which topology element contains the target.
For nearest neighbor, it gets the values at the vertex of that containing topology element closest to the target point. For weighted average, it
computes a weighted average of all vertices of that containing topology element, where the weights are bilinear in 2-D and trilinear in 3-D.
(source: Bill Hibbard, SSEC)
Q. Why can't I create a time series from single time grid files?
A. If you receive an error message similar to the following:
An error has occurred: Creating display: Color-Shaded Plan View org.python.core.PyException
visad.UnitException: visad.UnitException: Set: units dimension 1 does not match Domain
dimension 2
the files may not have a "time " dimension defined in them. It is recommended that you use the NetCDF Markup Language (NcML) to
aggregate the files. See http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/v2.2/Aggregation.html for more information on aggregating files.

Video Cards
Q. Do I need a special video card to run McIDAS-V?
A. Your graphics system must support 3D; make sure you have the latest video driver for your graphics card. This is included in the Windows
operating system. On Linux the driver must support GLX, an X windows system extension to OpenGL programs. See Operating System
Requirements for more information.
Q. Why does the display go grey or get corrupted when I resize my McIDAS-V display?

A. ATI cards do not always work correctly with the OpenGL version of Java 3D under Windows. If you experience problems with corrupted
displays (sets of triangles, spurious lines, weird looking displays) and have an ATI card and are running Windows, try the following:
Right click on the Windows Desktop and select Properties from the pop-up menu.
From the Settings tab, make sure the color quality is 16 bit.
Click the Advanced button and select the OpenGL tab. Depending on your card, either click the button for Force 16 bit buffer (or
something like that) or click on the Compatibility settings button and click the "Force 16 bit" radio button.
Click the OK buttons to exit the Display Properties dialog.
Try McIDAS-V again and see if it works better.
If not, try using the Direct-X installer instead of the OpenGL installer.
Q. If I'm having problems with the OpenGL version under Windows, can I run the Direct-X version Java 3D?
A. If you are using the version of Java 3D distributed with McIDAS-V (1.3.2), you can switch between the OpenGL and Direct-X versions of
Java 3D with a command line switch. If you are using runMcV.bat to start McIDAS-V, edit that file and uncomment the appropriate line. If
you have your own script for starting McIDAS-V, add in the - Dj3d.rend=d3d option to your start line (before -jar or class name).

Potential Problems
Q. How do I connect to remote servers through my firewall?
A. If you have a firewall and are trying to get data from the remote servers (image, radar, point, upper air and profiler data), error messages
such as "Error opening connection ... Operation timed out " or "No Data Available " may occur. For these servers to send data, your firewall
software must allow connections on ports 112 (ADDE) and 8080 (THREDDS Data Server).
Q. Why do I get an error that starts something like "Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x6F79CE1 " when starting McIDAS-V
under Linux?
A. If the error message also includes a line that is looking for a Library with "dri" in it's name (e.g.:
Library=/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/i915_dri.so), it means that you are trying to load the DRI library in your X server which is not compatible
with Java 3D. You need to comment out the line:
Load "dri"
in your X server configuration file (xorg.conf or XF86Config).

Common Installation Error Messages
Error #1
A user reported --- The first time I ran the script, it told me I needed to upgrade my JDK. So I installed jdk1.6.0_03 and Java3D 1.3.1. Then
McV installed without any problem.
Error #2 - On Mac OS X only
You have no write premissions for this directory. Please choose another one.
Solution
Browse for a writable directory (e.g. /Users/mcuser/McIDAS-V). Under "Select Additional Tasks ", uncheck "Create Launcher and
Configuration shortcuts in Applications folder "
Error #3 - On Mac OS X only
At Extracting files... McIDAS-V Configuration.app/Contents/Info.plist /Applications/McIDAS-V
Configuration.app/Contents/Info.plist Could not create this file. Shall I try again?
Solution
Click "Cancel " and restart the installer. Follow instructions under Error #2 above.

Common Run-Time Error Messages
Error #1
Could not create a graphics configuration. Please contact McIDAS-V user support or see the
FAQ.
And this error message in the shell window:
GLX version 1.3 or higher is required The reported version number may be incorrect. There is
a known ATI driver bug in glXQueryVersion that incorrectly reports the GLX version as 1.2
when it really is 1.3, so Java 3D will attempt to run anyway.
Solution

First, check for the most updated video card driver. If the problem still remains, the 32bit Linux installer comes with an option to install
Java3D 1.3. Rerun the installer and select to install Java3D 1.3.
Error #2
JAVA 3D ERROR: GLX extension is not supported GLX version 1.3 or higher is required.
This error messages echoes to the terminal window. I also get an error popup window stating "Could not create a graphics configuration.
Please contact McIDAS-V users support or see the FAQ. " At this point the McIDAS-V startup scroll bar just keeps doing it's thing until I press
"ok " in the error popup window at which point the startup exits back to the terminal window.
Solution
GLX is an extension that must be supported by the graphics card. This error is most likely occurring because the graphics drivers for RHEL
are not properly configured.
Assuming that the latest graphics drivers are installed, they must be configured in the window system configuration file... since RHEL uses
Xorg, look in the file
/etc/X11/xorg.conf
and see if there are any references to "GLX" or "glx " (and possibly "dri"). If there are, try uncommenting them and rebooting.
Error #3
I have the viewing and data windows and a user's guide up. But so far I can't talk to any of the listed data servers. The errors are just
'connection refused' and 'no public datasets found' on every server I've tried.
Solution
If you have a firewall and are trying to get data from the remote servers (image, radar, point, upper air and profiler data), error messages such
as "Error opening connection ... Operation timed out " or "No Data Available " are normal. For these servers to send data, your firewall
software must allow connections on ports 112 (ADDE) and 8080 (THREDDS Data Server).
Error #4
If I move the McIDAS-V windows to Monitor2 of my two-monitor system, some things don't work correctly. For example, if I try to add a
new tab the data display section of the main display window goes blank ( "grays out "), or if I try to run a bundle it fails with, "Error loading
bundle C: adding a container to a container on a different GraphicsDevice".
Solution
Some graphics card/driver combinations don't allow these functions to work in Monitor2 of two-monitor systems. For now, you can simply
move the McIDAS-V windows to Monitor1 then successfully add new tabs and run bundles.
If you are running Red Hat with a NVIDIA graphics card using TwinView and are having problems, go to the preferences, click on the primary
display, and make sure the "Make this the primary display..." checkbox is checked.
Error #5
When I start McIDAS-V the main display window is blank - there is no map. There are also no errors in the console.
Solution
Try changing your memory to use 1 GB or lower and restart McIDAS-V. You can change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V by
editing the Maximum Heap Size in the Advanced tab of the Preferences by selected Edit->Preferences... from the main menu.

Getting Started
This section describes how to quickly get started using McIDAS-V and making displays of common data available.

McIDAS-V Main Windows
There are two main windows in the McIDAS-V application - - the Data Explorer window and the Main Display window. Other windows may
appear when needed.

Data Explorer
The Data Explorer window is central to McIDAS-V. It is used to choose data sources and parameters to display, the kinds of displays to make,
and times of data to display. More information about the Data Explorer can be found here.

Main Display
The Main Display (shown below with one Display Tab) includes the McIDAS-V display panels, legend, time animation controls, view point
controls for 3D displays, icons to zoom and pan, menus of projections, and the main McIDAS-V menu. More information about this window can
be found here.

the location based on the directory name but you can specify the location using the Radar Location menu.
5. When done, load the selected radar data with the Add Source button. The local data source will be shown in the Field Selector .

Displaying Gridded Data
This section describes how to make displays using gridded data sets. The steps include:
Connecting to a Data Source on a Remote Server
Creating a Plot of 2D Data
Creating a Plot of 3D Data
Subsetting Times
Spatial Subsetting

Connecting to a Data Source on a Remote Server
In the Data Sources tab in the Data Explorer select Gridded Data -> Remote under the "General" source. For more information about the
catalog chooser, see Choosing Gridded Data .

Choose one of the remote Catalogs: such as http://thredds.cise-nsf.gov:8080/thredds/idv/models.xml for Unidata's catalog of near real-time
model output.
A tree view of the catalog will be displayed. Open one, such as the "NCEP GFS 80km CONUS model data (real and near time)", by clicking on
one of the tab icons (

).

The list of this model's run times appears. Click on one time to select it, and then click on the Add Source button. You have selected this model
run's output to be accessible by McIDAS-V.

Creating a Plot of 2D Data
The gridded data source that you selected will be shown in the Field Selector tab. The Field Selector tab contains folders of data categorized as
2D and 3D fields. Click on the 2D grid tab ( ) to expand that category list. A list of all 2D grid parameters in the data source appears. When
one of the fields is selected the list of applicable displays will be shown.

Try creating a Contour Plan View by selecting that display in the list and clicking on the Create Display button. The display will be created and
shown in the main window. The display's legend should also be shown. You can bring up the control window by right clicking on the name in the
legend and selecting Control Window from the popup menu.

Creating a Plot of 3D Data
Click on the 3D grid tab to expand that category. A list of all 3D grid parameters appears. To make a plot, first click on a parameter name such as
"Geopotential height at isobaric levels."
Display types suitable for this parameter are listed in then Displays panel. Select Contour Plan View and click on the Create Display button.
The initial plot is at the lowest level in the data grid, such as 1000 millibar in this example. To shift the level to other levels:
Right click on the legend (such as "T Contour Plan View Level 1000") to get a pop-up menu.
Click on Control Window to bring up this display's Control window.
In the Control window click on the Levels: box to bring up the pop-up menu of native grid levels in the data.
Select the desired level, such as 500, from the list.
The plot will move to 500 millibars.
To zoom, rotate, or pan this 3D display, see Zoom, Rotate, and Pan. Rotate the display by dragging with the right mouse button. (You will see that
the 500 millibar contours are above the surface). The key combination Ctrl-R will restore the display to the original overhead view.
To toggle on the time animation loop, use the Run/Stop icon in the time animation controls.
To remove an existing display, use the File->Remove Display menu of the Layer Controls tab or the popup menu.

Subsetting Times
McIDAS-V automatically loads data for all data times selected in the data selection step, and loads them as displays for an animation loop.
Creating several displays may take time. If you only need to see one data time, it is better to only create displays for that time.
To make time selections that apply to all data in one data source, double click on the data source name in the left panel of the Field Selector tab
to bring up the Data Source Properties editor. Click on the Times tab to subset the times.

Initially all times are selected for display by McIDAS-V - indicated by the times in this window being grayed out and the box "Use All" being
checked. To limit the selection to fewer times than all times, first check off the box "Use All." Then select the times you want by clicking on the
times (note: you can select multiple times with the Shift and Control keys).
To make time selections for one field, use the Times selector in the lower right panel of the Fields tab, under the Displays panel, after you select
the field, and before you create the display. This will override the default times for the data source.

Spatial Subsetting
You can also spatially subset the grid using the Spatial Subset tab of the Data Source Properties. This works similar to the times subsetting where
you can set the property for all fields in the Data Source or override the default for a particular field.

image or use one as a reference spectrum.

The Multispectral Display
Change the wavenumber being displayed to 852.25 cm-1 by entering in the value into the Wavenumber: box in the Multispectral Display and
hitting enter. Move the magenta and light blue spectra probes to the approximate locations in the image below to locate an inversion at the
location of the red box over Albania.

Once the two probes are in the approximate locations, the MultiSpectral window should look similar to the image below.

Zoom in over the 852.25 cm-1 region using the Ctrl+Left Click+Drag combination to create a box of the region to zoom in on. If you miss the
region, or want to return to the full spectra, use Shift+Left Click . The inversion should become clear as you zoom in, as shown in the image
below.

Using the McIDAS-X Bridge
This section describes how to create displays from a McIDAS-X bridge session. The McIDAS-X Bridge provides a way to load data from an
active McIDAS-X sesssion into McIDAS-V. Note: The McIDAS-X bridge will only work if you have McIDAS-X, and are updated to at
least version 2007a or later. If you do not, proceed to the next section.
The set of steps include:
Starting the McIDAS-X Bridge Listener
Creating a McIDAS-X Bridge Session
Creating a McIDAS-X Display in McIDAS-V

Starting the McIDAS-X Bridge Listener
To start the McIDAS-X bridge listener, type MCLISTEN START in a running McIDAS-X session (version 2007a or later) on a remote or local
machine.

Creating a McIDAS-X Bridge Session
In the Data Explorer window select McIDAS-X Bridge from the Data Sources tab to view the chooser. For more information about the
McIDAS-X Bridge chooser, see Creating a McIDAS-X Bridge Session.

If you are connecting to the listener on your local macahine, connect to the defaults of localhost listening on port 8080, otherwise enter in a host
name and the corresponding port number and click Add Source . If MCLISTEN START was not run on the local or remote host, an error box
will say that the "Connection to McIDAS-X Bridge Listener at localhost:8080 failed".
The data source is shown in the Field Selector tab. The Frame Sequence will be listed in the "Fields" tab. Click the
tree tab to the left of
"Frame Sequence" to expand that list and list all available frames in the connected McIDAS-X session. You have the option to select all available
McIDAS-X frames, or one single frame. Select the "Frame Sequence", and create a "McIDAS-X Image Display" by clicking the Create Display
button.

Creating a McIDAS-X Display in McIDAS-V
The McIDAS-X bridge session will be in the Layer Controls tab of the Data Explorer mirroring the McIDAS-X frame(s) selected. You can enter
McIDAS-X commands in the "Command Line" text entry box at the bottom of the Layer Controls tab. This will run McIDAS-X commands, and
the McIDAS-V display in the Layer Controls tab will update to reflect the results. Although the bridge session resembles a normal McIDAS-X
session, interactive commands are not implemented, but recall commands do work.

Image 1: McIDAS-X Bridge Controls
Create a loop of satellite images in the McIDAS-X bridge session without displaying a map. Import these McIDAS-X frames into the current
McIDAS-V 3D panel by selecting the Settings tab and checking the "Display data in main 3D panel" option. This will import all of the navigated
McIDAS-X frames into the 3D panel. It is recommended that you do not use maps from McIDAS-X when importing frames, as their quality
diminishes as you zoom in on the 3D display.
If at any time you receive an error message: Selected image(s) not available , it is due to the fact that McIDAS-V will only import navigated
frames. In cases where you have a combination of navigated and non-navigated frames, McIDAS-V will import the navigated frames into
McIDAS-V. Non-navigated frames will remain in your 2D display in the Layer Controls.

Data Explorer
The McIDAS-V Data Explorer window contains many of the common non-view windows:

Image 1: McIDAS-V Data Explorer

Data Sources
See here for more information.

Field Selector
See here for more information.

Layer Controls
The Layer Controls tab holds the Display Control windows. For each Display Control there is a small toolbar at the bottom of the tab:

Image 2: Data Explorer Toolbar
This allows you to undock the window from the Data Explorer, show display control properties, remove the display control, and drag and drop to
a window component.
Once a Layer Control window is undocked from the Data Explorer it can be re-docked through the View->Dock in Data Explorer menu item.

Choosing Data Sources
McIDAS-V can use data from local files, remote data servers such as OPeNDAP or ADDE and even web servers. You can read further about
specific sources of data available.
The general idea is to select the sources of data that you want to work with within McIDAS-V using the Data Sources tab. Once selected, the data
source will be shown in the Field Selector window where you can choose parameters, times and the displays to create.
McIDAS-V can work with any number of data sources at one time. Choosing a data source with McIDAS-V typically just reads the metadata
(i.e., data about the data), no parameter data values are read until you request a display to be made.
To select the data that is to be used in McIDAS-V you use the Data Sources tab, which is brought up by:
Selecting the Data Sources tab in the Data Explorer.
The Display->Create Layer from Data Source... menu item in the main menu bar.

1. Click on the data source of interest in the Data Sources list:

2. Select the field you want to display:

3. Select the display type:

4. Optionally subset the times by clicking off the Use Default button and selecting the times:

5. For grids, optionally subset the levels and/or spatial area:

6. For images, optionally subset the spatial area to be displayed.
Use the Region tab to left-click drag to select a geographical region to display:

Use the Advanced tab to further refine your data selection and refer back to the Region tab to view the image you've selected:

7. Press "Create Display":

Data Sources
The left panel shows Data Sources , chosen as described in Choosing Data Sources. You can right click on a data source in the list to show a
popup menu:

Image 2: Data Source Popup Menu
This allows you to Remove the data source, reload its data, change the data source, show its Properties window, etc.
The Save as Quick Link item will save this data source off as a favorite and make it available in the "Favorite Data Sources" tab of the Quick
Links tab of the Data Explorer. Gridded data has additional options that allow you to make the grid local, or write a field mask plugin.

Fields
Selecting a data source in the left panel will list the available fields in the Fields tree. This list is usually hierarchical showing different categories
of fields (e.g., 2D grids, 3D grids, image sequences, etc.). To see the fields under a particular category click on the toggle icon

.

Selecting a field will show the list of displays available in the Displays list and subsetting information (e.g., times, spatial subset).

Subsetting
The "Subsetting" component of the Field Selector allows you to subset the data in both time and space (if possible). If there are times in the data
source you are viewing they will be shown in this area. Likewise, if it is possible to do spatial subsetting or decimation a "Spatial Subset" tab will
be shown.
Time and spatial subsetting defaults can be applied to the data source itself through the Data Source Properties dialog or the defaults can be
overwritten through the Field Selector window.

Creating Displays
The Display tree shows a hierarchical list of the available displays for a particular field. Click on the type of display you want from the choices
listed in the Displays tree. You can see examples of Display Types in this User's Guide.
You can select two or more displays (different display types) at one time. For an additional display, hold down the CTRL key and click on the
second display type desired. Then go ahead and create the display as normal; all selected displays will be made. To make the display click on the
button Create Display (or double click on the display).

Derived Parameters
McIDAS-V provides derived parameters - - parameters not provided by the original source data, but made from the source data with
computations by McIDAS-V. The intent is to provide commonly used fields (such as dewpoint when dewpoint is not provided by the data source),
but when it can be derived from source data (such as humidity and temperature).
These automatic derived parameters are offered when the required data to compute them are available, based on parameter names.
Since few data sets use the same names for parameters, McIDAS-V keeps of a list of "aliases" or particular parameter names that match with
"canonical" names which are generally understood by all McIDAS-V users and which McIDAS-V uses for computations. You can add your
special parameter names to the list of aliases. Read the Parameter Alias section in this guide for information on using that facility.
All needed source parameters for one derived parameter must come from one single data source (e.g. from one single netCDF file). McIDAS-V
attempts to find derived parameters that can be made from data in each data source in the data source panel, but not from all possible combination
of data sources. If you had separate files of u and v wind components, for example, the parameter names or aliases will not create Derived wind
vectors.

Formula Data Source

You can create your own formulas using the McIDAS-V Formulas facility. The Formulas data source in the Field Selector is a special data
source and lists all of the available end user formulas. You can right-click on the data source to create new formulas and import and export
formulas. The formulas are listed in the Fields tree. Right clicking on one of the formulas listed in the Fields tree allows you to edit, copy or
evaluate the formula.
You can select a formula just like any other field and create a display from it. However, the formula, when evaluated to create the display, usually
needs one or more other data fields to act on. In this case a special Field Selector window is shown that allows the user to select the fields for the
formula. (Note: the fields you select here can also be formula fields resulting in further field selection).

Data Source Properties
To set the defaults for a data source bring up the Properties dialog by right clicking (or double clicking) on the data source name in the data
sources panel of the Field Selector window and select Properties :

The Properties Dialog is different for different types of data sources. Here is the dialog window for a gridded data source:

Any displays that are showing data from a data source can be automatically updated by selecting the Reload Displays button. When this is
selected all data will be reloaded and the displays will be updated when the user presses Apply or OK.

Basic Properties
You can change the displayed name with the Name field.
Some data sources can automatically update themselves by selecting the Active button. For example, if you had a set of most recent satellite
images you can turn on Polling and have the data update to the latest images every N minutes.
For point data you can define Time Binning settings (not shown) by selecting a Bin Size (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) and a Round To value (e.g., On
the hour, 15 minutes after the hour). This will map all the observation times into the nearest bin. The smallest time is rounded with the Round To
value (e.g., if Round To was "10 after" and the smallest time was 10:23 then this time would be rounded to 10:20). This is the base time. Each
actual observation time is mapped into a set of bins of Bin Size starting at the base time.

Times
The Times tab allows you to select the times to use. Click off the Use All button and select individual times. You can right mouse click in the list
to show a popup menu that allows you to select different strides (e.g., every 3rd time).

Spatial Subsetting
For grids and other data source types the data can be subset and decimated with the Spatial Subset tab. The X Stride, Y Stride and Z Stride
menus allow you to decimate a grid, selecting every Nth point. The Bounding Box allows you to define a spatial area to load. The default spatial
domain of the data is shown by the blue outline box. To select an area just drag on the map. Once a subset is selected it can be resized (grab on
the little black selection points) moved (grab somewhere near the box) and delete (press the Delete key). Specific lat/lon values can be entered in
the fields on the left.

A version of this spatial subsetting window is used in the Field Selector. Here, you explicitly enable these settings. The decimation and spatial
subset are shown in different tabs:

Details
The Details tab shows further information about the data source, e.g.: any documentation associated with the data, what files or urls are used, etc.

Metadata
For grid data sources the Metadata tab shows the NetCDF metadata.

Time Animation
Time Animation Widget
Time Animation Properties Dialog
Settings Tab
Define Animation Times Tab

Time Animation Widget
Each McIDAS-V display area has a set of time animation controls above the main display window.

The Time Animation Widget controls looping of displays through time. A series of small green boxes is displayed representing each frame of the
animation. The box corresponding to the current time is colored blue. Click on a box to select a different time. Right click on a box to disable that
frame in the animation. Disabled boxes will be colored red. The time of the data is displayed in the labeled pull-down list and in the entries of the
pull down list on the left. The toolbar of button icons, on the right, control time animation. Reading from left to right, the icons on the Time
Animation Widget do the following:
Show the first frame, and stop looping if looping is on.
Step Back one frame.
Toggle looping on or off.
Step Forward one frame.
Show the last frame, and stop looping if looping is on.
Show the Time Animation Properties dialog box.

Time Animation Properties Dialog
Click on the

in the animation controls to see the Time Animation Properties Dialog box. This dialog has two tabs.

By pressing Apply or OK you will set the properties in the Animation Widget. If you have the Save As Default button checked then the
properties will be saved off and used every time a new Animation Widget is created. For example, you may find that you are always setting the
dwell rate to a particular value. You can save that state off as the default state for all Animation Widgets that are subsequently created, both in the
current run of McIDAS-V and in future runs.

Settings Tab
The first tab allows you to change the values that control looping.
The Dwell controls how fast the animation occurs. Click on the slider icon:

to change the values. Values are seconds/frame.

Forward controls speed of looping forward.
Reverse controls speed of looping backwards.
First how long first frame is seen.
Last how long last frame is seen.
Select the looping style with the Direction menu.
Forward Loop forward in time
Backward Loop backward in time
Rocking Looping alternates between forward and backward directions.
Share the time animation in a display with the animation in other displays with the Share Times button. See here for more information.
Check Boxes Visible to show the boxes in the Time Animation Widget. The time boxes allow you to configure which frames will be disabled in
the Time Animation Widget. This behaves the same as the boxes in the main widget.

You can also set the behavior for when the set of times available changes with the Reset->To menu. The options are the Start Time, End Time, or
No Change.

Define Animation Times Tab
The second tab allows you to define a custom animation time set.

By default, the times used in the animation time set are all of the times from the data that is being displayed. However, you can define your own
time set by selecting the Define your own list of times button.
You define how to determine the start time, end time and a time interval. The time interval is used to create the set of time steps (inclusive)
between the start and end times. The start time and end time modes are determined one of four ways:
Use Minimum/Maximum Time from Data This takes the time from the data that is being displayed.
Current Time (Now) This automatically updates the animation time set to use the current clock time. This is useful for animation of real
time data. If you select this option you can then define how often the animation set is updated with the Refresh Rate field. The Round To
field allows you to specify a rounding factor.
Fixed This mode allows to you to specify a fixed date/time.
Relative to End/Start time This mode uses the other time as the base time. For example, you could set the end time to be the Current
Time. And set the start time to be relative to the end time minus 1 hour (using the start time offset field). Note: you cannot have start and
end times both be relative to one another.
Once you select the start and end time modes you can define an offset which is added (or subtracted) to the base time. To change the offset select
the
button. When you do this the Offset Dialog will be shown:

This allows you to define a time offset by entering years, days, hours and minutes. Note, you can also specify a sign, "-" or "+".
By pressing apply you can apply the changes that you have made. This is also a good way to see if there are any errors. For example, the end time
cannot be less than the start time.

Zooming, Panning and Rotating
There are several methods to zoom, pan, and rotate in McIDAS-V. You can use the mouse, the arrow keys, a rubber band box, or the Zoom/Pan
Toolbar. To reset to the initial base viewpoint use the key combination Control-r.
Note: You need to click in the view window when using key combinations.
Note: If you are using an Apple Mac with a single button mouse, see below .
Zooming
Shift-Left Mouse Drag: Select a region by
pressing the Shift key and dragging the left
mouse button (MB1).
Shift-Right Mouse Drag: Hold Shift key and
drag the right mouse button (MB3). Moving up
zooms in, moving down zooms out.

Panning

axis.
Shift-Left/Right Arrow: Rotate
clockwise/counter clockwise.

The default mouse and keyboard controls can be customized using the Navigation controls preferences tab by selecting Edit->Preferences from
the main menu.

Apple Mac One Button Mouse Controls
Mouse controls are a bit more challenging if you are running McIDAS-V on a Mac with a single mouse button. The typical left mouse button
(MB1) functions are done with a click of the button. Right mouse options (MB3) are simulated using the Option key with a mouse click. Use the
following:
Option + click to rotate
Shift + Option + click to zoom
There is no replacement for the mouse panning actions on the Mac. Use the keyboard arrow functions or the Viewpoint toolbar instead.

The Viewpoint Toolbar
The Viewpoint Toolbar allows you to quickly switch the point of view to any of six choices, including from overhead (the same as you
see in a new display), from below, and from north, east, south or west. The buttons show the side of the point of view looking into the
3D display volume. Click on any of the buttons to change the point of view. The top button for overhead is also useful if the display is
in a confusing state and you want to get oriented.
The other three buttons allow you to switch perspective between converging to infinity and not converging, define your own viewpoint
settings, and set the vertical limits.
You can "tear away" the toolbar and place it elsewhere on your screen as a tiny window by dragging with the right mouse button on the
textured area above the toolbar. Clicking on the x on the toolbar will then restore the toolbar to its original location.
You can specify any viewpoint exactly from any angle in 3D you like using the View->Viewpoint->Viewpoint Dialog menu choice.

The Zoom/Pan Toolbar
The Zoom/Pan Toolbar allows you to zoom and pan. Clicking on the "plus" icon zooms in, centered on the center of the display.
Clicking on the "minus" icon zooms out, centered on the center of the display. Clicking on the "house" icon restores the initial point of
view of this projection (overhead, centered on center of the map projection in use). Clicking on one of the arrow buttons moves the point
of view in the direction of the button; the display moves in the opposite direction. If you click on the up button, the map and display
move down.
You can "tear away" the toolbar and place it elsewhere on your screen as a tiny window by dragging with the right mouse button on the
textured area above the toolbar. Clicking on the x on the toolbar will then restore the toolbar to its original location.

The Viewpoint Undo/Redo Buttons
The Undo and Redo buttons allow you to undo or redo viewpoint changes.

Transect Views
The Transect View is a 2-Dimensional display that shows data along a transect line. This type of view can be created through the File->New
Display Tab(Window)->Transect Display menu.

Image 1: Transect view of wind speed.
The left vertical axis shows altitude in meters, the right axis shows pressure levels. The horizontal axis shows distance along the transect. You can
zoom and pan in this display with the normal key and mouse combinations.
The transect line that is being used in this view can be displayed or changed through the Transects->Edit menu. This creates a Transect Drawing
Control that is shown in another Map View. The Transect Drawing Control allows you to create or modify transect lines. Note, when you change
a transect line the Transect View is automatically changed. You can also select any of the pre-defined or user created transects from the
Transects menu as well.
In the Transects tab of the Properties dialog for the Transect View (from View->Properties ) you can define a maximum distance to show.
Normally, data that lies with the bounding lines that are orthogonal to the transect line is shown in this display. The max distance gives a display
radius. Data that lies past this max distance is not displayed.

Overview
A Layer Control is the interface through which a layer can be managed. A layer is usually shown in a view though they can be stand-alone.

Legend
The legend in the Main Window lists the set of Layer Controls within that view. In the image below, the legend has been floated from the main
view window into its own window. This is done with the
Float Window button (the
Embed Window button will move the legend back into
the main window).

Image 1: Side Legend
The legend shows each layer under the "layer category" of that display. For example, the legend in the above image shows the categories "Maps",
"Plan Views", "Probes", "3D Surface" and "Imagery". The layer category may be changed (see below). This is useful for grouping and controlling
the visibility of a group of layers.
The legend label shows the parameter or field name, the display type, and sometimes other information such as the level of a plan view or value
of an isosurface. The label may be changed by a user using items under the Edit->Properties menu item (described below). Clicking on the
highlighted part of the label will bring up the layers control window. Right clicking will bring up the layers control menu.
Each layer category within the legend can be toggled to show or hide the layers under that category with the Toggle Category button. The details
of a layer can also be toggled with the Toggle Details button. The visibility of the layers under a category (i.e., the graphical display within the
main view window) can be changed with the Category Visibility Checkbox . The visibility of an individual layer can be changed with the Layer
Visibility Checkbox
The Remove button allows you to quickly remove a layer. The
and not change it while doing the visibility cycling .

Visibility Toggle Lock allows you to "lock" the current visibility of the layer

Detailed information about a layer may also be shown in the legend. For example, for those layer that use a color table, the color bar will also be
shown in the legend. Moving the mouse over the color bar shows intermediate values. Click on the color bar to get a Color Table Editor with the
color table for that layer.

Drag and Drop
A display control's drag and drop button is shown in the Data Explorer when the display control is docked. By clicking and dragging on this
button you can drop it into another View to change which View the display control is in. Also, within the data explorer you can drop it onto one
of the View labels to also change the View. Within the legend you can also drag the button onto another Category label to change the display
category.

Menus
All layer control windows share a common set of File, Edit, View, and Help menu items, shown in the menu bar. Different controls may also
have custom items in these menus as well.
The File menu has these common choices:
Remove Display
Remove the display.
Save
A variety of ways of saving the state of the display.
Save Data in Cache
This allows you to save the current data of the display in a Cache Data Source as a new Field. You will be prompted for the name of
the field. You can use this in a variety of ways:
After calculating a complex formula, selecting operands for the formula, etc., to create the data in a display you can save off the

formula and the data that was calculated. Then you can create new displays from that formula without having to reselect the
operands and recalculate the final data.
In a Web Map Server (WMS) display this allows you to capture the image and then make use of it in formulas and in other
displays. For example, you can drape the image over topography.
Save As Parameter Defaults
Allows you to save the current display state for the parameter as the default for that parameter in the future. See the Parameter
Defaults Editor page for more information.
Save Display as Favorite
Allows you to save the current display state (without the data) as a Favorite Display.
Save Display as Bundle
Allows you to save the current application state as a bundle or Web Start JNLP file.
Reload Data
Reload the data for this display.
Close Window
If the Display Control is shown in its own window this is used to close the control window. It normally doesn't remove the control (unless a
preference has been set).
The Edit menu has these common choices:
Color Table
For displays that have a color table this menu allows you to edit the color table, change the range, choose a new color table, etc.
Selector Color, et. al.
Some displays (e.g., data probe) use a single color in the display (e.g., for showing the selector point or line). Use this menu to set the color.
Change Parameter
Some displays allow you to change the data parameter that is being used.
Change Display Unit
Some displays allow you to change the unit that is used in the display, e.g., changing temperature plots in Kelvin to Celsius.
Change Contours
Displays with contours allow you to change the unit that is used in the display.
Use Times in Animation
For displays that have a time associated with them, you can select whether the times are used to calculate the animation steps.
Sharing
This sub-menu allows you to turn on/off sharing and to set the "share group". When sharing is turned on certain state is shared among
displays of the same type that are in the same share group. The share group can be an arbitrary name.
For example, the location of a vertical cross section, the color table, location of a probe point, etc., can all be shared.
Properties
The Properties dialog allows you to change the display label, the display category, the id and the color scale properties for this display.
The View menu has these common choices:
Visible
Checkbox allows you to toggle visibility.
Lock Visibility
Checkbox allows you to toggle the visibility lock (see visibility cycling below).
Bring To Front
If this display is showing at the same level in 3D as another (e.g., satellite and radar images in the same display), you can use this menu to
select which display is on top.
Show View Window
Show the View Window that holds this layer control.
Use Times in Animation
For layers that have a time associated with them, you can select whether the times are used to calculate the animation steps.
Display List
Allows you to set the color and visibility of the label for this control in the display list.
Use Data Projection
This will change the projection used in the view to the native projection of the display.
The Help menu has these common choices:
Details
Selecting this item brings up a window that shows detailed information about the display and any associated data.
User's Guide
Bring up the user guide entry for the particular display.

Properties Dialog
The Properties dialog is brought up with the Edit->Properties menu:

Image 2: Display Control Properties
The Display Category field is arbitrary text and is used to organize the legend. The "<<" button shows a list of all of the current display
categories and allows you to easily set this field.
The Legend Label field is the label used in the legend of this display control. It can contain arbitrary text as well as a set of "macros". The
macros can be added to the label with the Add Macro button:
Short Name This is the short name of the parameter being displayed.
Long Name This is the long name of the parameter being displayed.
Data Source Name This is the name of the data source that produced the parameter being displayed.
Display Name The name of the display.
Timestamp The time of the data that is currently being displayed using the default time format preference. You can also use a macro of the
form %time:<time pattern>% to set a specific time format other than the default. <time pattern> follows the same rules defined in the User
Preferences section. For example, %time:HHz EEE dd MMM yyyy% would give something like 12GMT Fri 16 Feb 2007.
... And other values depending on the display.
The Extra Legend Labels field acts like the Legend Label field (e.g., with macros).
The Layer Label field acts like the Legend Label field to define the text label that is shown in the display list. The colored rectangle to the right
of the layer label changes the color. Left click and use the pull down menu to specify a color or create a custom color.
The Id field is used to define an ID for this display. The ID is used for accessing particular displays from the McIDAS-V Scripting Language .
There may be a variety of check boxes:
Show In Layer List Allows you to toggle the visibility of the label in the view window. Note that you must enable showing the list of
display labels that are toggled on using the View->Properties dialog of the view window, or by setting the global property for all display
through the User Preferences dialog.
Lock Visibility Toggle Locks/unlocks visibility toggling .
Show Note Text Arbitrary text notes can be added to a display. This checkbox menu item shows or hides the text field that allows you to
edit the notes.
Use Fast Rendering When this is checked on, McIDAS-V will not try to account for projection seams. This will cause displays to be
rendered faster at the expense of accuracy.
There may be other tabs shown, depending on the display. For example, the Color Scale tab allows you to configure where the color scale bar is
shown. The Spatial Subset tab allows you to define further spatial subsetting of the data.

Color Scale
For those controls that include color tables, you can display the color scale (legend) in the main view window. Use the options under the Color
Scale tab to configure the positioning and labelling of the color scale.

Image 3: Color Scale Properties

Display Visibility
In the legend the Display Visibility checkbox to the left of the label can be used to toggle the visibility of that layer.
The function keys F1, F2, F3* can be used to cycle visibility as follows:
The F1 key cycles visibility through all non-locked layers, looping through each layer one at a time.
The F2 turns on all non-locked layers.
The F3 turns off all non-locked layers.
*On a Mac laptop, you may need to press the "Fn" key along with the particular function key .
The padlock icon on the right side of the legend bar is used to block the effects of the visibility toggling described above. When locked
the visibility of a layer is not affected by the toggling.
Use the View->Visible checkbox menu item in each layer control's menu.

Properties
Contours
For the Contour and Color-Filled Contour Plan View there is a Contour: Change button that brings up the Contour Properties Editor. The
current contour interval is shown.
Color Table
The control has a color bar showing the active color table and the associated high and low data values in the units the display is made in. As
the mouse pointer is moved over the color bar, the value at a particular color is shown. Click on the color bar to start the Color Table Editor.
Or click on the button that displays the name of the color table to show a popup menu that allows you to change the range, select other color
tables, etc. This menu can also be accessed through the Edit->Color Table menu.
Vertical Position
This slider allows you to set the verical position of the image (For 2D displays).
Visible Range
In the Color Shaded Plan View the Visible Range allows you to set the range that determines what parts of the data is actually shown.
When checked, use the Change button to set the range of data shown.
Texture Quality
The Texture Quality slider allows you to set the quality of the displayed texture of the Color Shaded Plan View. A higher quality will take
longer to render and user more memory.
Smoothing
This control has an option to smooth the grid that can be used to smooth contour lines or flow fields for display. There are three types of
smoothing: 5-point, 9-point and gaussian weighted smoothers. The amount of smoothness can be set for the gaussian smoother. The higher
the amount, the smoother the grid.
Levels
Click on the Levels box to see a pull down menu of the native grid levels. Click on one level value to reset the plan to that level. The plan
level in use is shown in the data's native altitude units. The Levels box is editable. Click in the box, enter a value and hit return to set your
own value.

The alternative is coloring an area of pixels corresponding to a single data grid cell with one color. Click off the Shade Colors box in the
control window to see this display.
Mode
The Mode selector allows you set the way the texture is displayed. You can select Solid, Mesh, or points. This is useful for looking at the
structure of the underlying data used to create the Color Shaded Plan View.
Plan Selector

Another way to adjust the height of a Plan View through a 3D field is to drag the selector point (a colored rectangle) near the lower left
corner of the plot to a new height. The 3D display has to be rotated to see the display somewhat from the side to do this. The color of this
selector point can be changed through the Edit->Selector Color menu.

Flow Plan Controls
Overview
The Flow Plan View Controls are used to control plan (horizontal) displays (flow vectors, wind barbs, streamlines) of vector based data (e.g.,
wind components). They are similar to the Plan View controls. You can toggle between the vector and streamlines view and control the vector
size, color and skip interval.

control window to see this display.
Autoscale Y-Axis
When selected, the display will automatically scale the Y Axis to the data range along the selector line.
Time Animation Control

These controls start and stop looping of displays when more than one data time is loaded. See more in Time Animation Control.
Display
Use left-mouse button drag on the colored squares on the positioning line in the main view window to reposition the cross section.

Isosurface Controls
Overview
Isosurfaces can be made in two types of displays, regular isosurfaces, and isosurfaces colored by another field. An isosurface is a 3D surface
mapping the location of a single parameter value through a 3D field. Isosurfaces are a 3D analog of a single contour line in a 2D plot; the
intersection of an isosurface and any plane is a contour line of the same value in that plane.

You can request an isosurface colored with a range of colors, where colors indicate the values of another field, not the one used to make the shape
of the surface. A common use is to color isosurfaces by height (geopotential height in some grid output) to show height of features above the
surface by color.

Properties
Color Table
The control has a color bar showing the active color table and the associated high and low data values in the units the display is made in. As

Linear Combination Controls
Overview
The Linear Combinations controls are used to create and perform functions beyond the standard arithmetic functions in McIDAS-V. The console
tab consists of two parts - The spectra and the console:

The console allows a user to define multiple spectra and perform more complex mathmatical operations.

Command line functions
selector(wavenumber, color )
The selector Jython function creates a spectra line with a optionally defined color and wavelength. If no wavenumber parameter is found, a
data-dependent default value will be used. If no color parameter is found, the color of the selector bar will default to green. The spectra line
can be dragged between wavelength/wavenumbers.
Examples:
a = selector()
b = selector(1000)
c = selector('cyan')
d = selector(919.5,
'red')
e = selector('40',
'orange')
f = selector('11')

[ Creates a green selector named "a" at a data-dependent wavenumber or
wavelength]
[ Creates a green selector nambed "b" at wavenumber 1000.0 ]
[ Creates a cyan selector named "c" at a data-dependent wavenumber or
wavelength]
[ Creates a red selector named "d" at wavenumber 919.5 ]
[ Creates a orange selector named "e" at the wavenumber? associated with
band 40 ]
[ Creates a green selector named "f" at the wavenumber assocaited with band 11
]

combine(combination , name )
The combine Jython function computes the mathmatical operation corresponding to the expression entered. The results are available in the
Field Selector under the "MultiSpectral" tree in the Fields tab listed under the optional name. If no name was specified, the results will be
displayed using the expression that was computed. A combination is required for this function.
Examples:
a = selector('2', 'red')
b = selector('1',
'yellow')
c = ((a-b)/(a+b))

[ Creates a red selector named "a" at the wavenumber associated with band 2]
[ Creates a yellow selector nambed "b" at the wavenumber associated with band
1]
[ Creates a variable c that corresponds to the expression ((a-b)/(a+b))]
[ Results of the "c" variable will appear in the Field Selector as the "NDVI"
combine(c, 'NDVI')
entry ]
[ Results of the expression in the combination field will appear in the Field
combine((a-b)/(a+b))
Selector ]

print()
The print function prints out information about the current wavelength/wavenumber of a selector, or its value.

Probes
Data Probe/Time Series
Time-Height Controls
Vertical Profile Controls
Data Transect Controls

Data Probe/Time Series
Overview
The data probe shows a time series chart of one or more fields at a single location. It also shows a tabular readout of the value at the current
animation time step. In the image below we have a Probe Control showing three parameters: T, RH and windspeed. Their values at the current
animation time step are shown in the table and their time series are shown. Note, the T and RH fields are shown in one chart and the windspeed is
shown in another chart. You can have any number of fields and any number of charts. You can configure the layout of the charts, the chart
properties and the line properties for each parameter. See here for more information.

A small colored square Selector Point in the main McIDAS-V display shows where the probe is located. You can drag the probe point over the
map in the main display. You can change the probe point vertically as well.
The table shows the parameters with their values, the level at which the value is sampled, and the type of sampling. The location of the probe is
shown, in latitude, longitude, and altitude. When surface data is probed the height of the probe point does not matter.
You can add new parameters a number of ways:
Right click on the table and select Add Parameter...
Through the Edit->Add Parameter... menu.
Through the View->Parameters->Add Parameter... menu.

Parameter Properties
These parameter actions can be accessed by right clicking on the parameter row in the table or through the View->Parameters menu.
Copy
Copy the selected parameter. This allows you view the same parameter value at different locations or with different sampling methods.
Chart Properties
Allows you to change how the parameter is displayed in the chart. See here.
Change Unit
You can change the display unit for the selected parameter.
Set Sound...
You can define a sound type and range for the parameter. As the probe is moved around or the time animation is run a sound is applied
based on the value.
Remove
Remove the selected parameter.
Displays
You can directly create new display using the selected parameter.
Probing on Point Data
When probing on point data, the control will find the closest observation to the probe position and use that data to sample on.

Properties
Export Current Time as CSV
Export the current time step's data or all times as a comma separated file (CSV) by selecting the File->Save menu.

Export All Times as CSV
Export all times as a comma separated file (CSV) by selecting the File->Save menu.

location of the probe.
Levels
The Level column in the table shows the height of the sample point. Click in the level value box, and you can reset the level for that
parameter to other altitude values (in the native data set) with a selector list of levels that pops up. The level "Probe's" is whatever level the
probe happens to be at, which may not be a native level of the data. Note that once you set the level to a level not at the probe point, the
probe point no longer shows where the sample is from. The probe does have the same latitude and longitude as the data shown, but not the
altitude.
Sampling
Probe values can be interpolated from neighboring grid values, since the probe position almost never coincides exactly with the location of
a data point. The Sampling column shows if this interpolation is used. "Weighed average" uses interpolation of nearby data points; "Nearest
neighbor" gives the exact value of the datum in the grid cell where the probe is located .Click in the sampling column box, and you can set
the sampling method for that parameter.

Time-Height Controls
Overview
A time-height display is a display of samples of a 3D parameter along a vertical profile line from top to bottom of the available data, with time as

Gridded Point Data
Overview
McIDAS-V can create gridded fields of numeric data using the Barnes Objective Analysis. You can control the parameters used to create the grid
from the Data Source Properties or using the "Grid Parameters" tab in the Data Subset panel of the Field Selector:

The resulting grid can be displayed using any of the Gridded Data Displays.

Properties
Spacing
You can set the grid spacing as follows:
Automatic - grid spacing will be calculated from the observation density
Degrees - use a specific lat/lon spacing
# Points - set the number of grid points in the x and y direction
Grid Size
Specify the grid spacing if not using automatic calculation.
Passes
Set the number of passes for the Barnes analysis to do 4 passes recommended for analysing fields where derivative estimates are important
(Ref: Barnes 1994b) 3 passes recommended for all other fields (with gain set to 1.0) (Ref: Barnes 1994c "Two pass Barnes Objective
Analysis schemes now in use probably should be replaced by appropriately tuned 3pass or 4pass schemes") 2 passes only recommended for
"quick look" type analyses.
Search Radius
Set the search radius (in grid units) for the weighting of points in determining the value at a specific grid point. Should be in the range 0.2
to 1.0. Data are fitted more closely with a gain of 0.2 (at the expense of less overall accuracy over the entire grid); larger values smooth
more.
Gain
Factor by which scaleLength is reduced for the second pass. Should be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. Data are fitted more closely with a gain of
0.2 (at the expense of less overall accuracy over the entire grid); larger values smooth more. Suggested default: 1.0f Set the gain for each
pass after the first.
First Guess Field
You can use a model grid as a first guess field for the analysis. Select the "Grid Parameters (with first guess)" field and you will be
prompted to select the gridded field to use for the first guess.

Sounding Display Controls
Overview
The meteorological sounding display is available for:
RAOBs (balloon soundings)
numerical weather prediction model output with temperature and humidity. The dew-point temperature is computed by internal code from
temperature and relative humidity grids.
from a local file that contains aircraft track data.
To load sounding data see Choosing RAOB Sounding Data and Displaying Gridded Data . The sounding display consists of a table of aerological
parameters and three tabs in the Layer Controls . The first includes an aerological (thermodynamic) diagram (e.g., skew-T, Stuve, Emagram):

Image 1: The Grid Sounding Control with a Skew-T
A label at the top of the sounding window shows the latitude-longitude position of the sounding. The RAOB station location is shown on the main
McIDAS-V display as a small colored square. When displaying sounding plots made from gridded model output, the position of the sounding is
shown in the main 3D view window by a solid-color selector point and vertical line. You can move this model-output-based sounding position
over the map by dragging the selector point with the left button.
When displaying a sounding diagram made from gridded numerical weather model output, there is a pull-down selector menu of the model output
valid times in the upper right corner.
The animation control buttons are available in either case:

To increase precision using the sounding diagram, enlarge the window by dragging on the edges. You can zoom the sounding diagram by holding
down the Shift key and dragging the right button upwards; drag downwards to zoom out. You can pan the diagram by dragging the mouse pointer
in any direction while pressing the right mouse button.
The temperature and dew-point traces can be modified via the cursor. Press the left button on the first data-point to be modified and drag it
horizontally along an isobar to the desired position, then move the pointer diagonally along an isotherm to keep the data-point at the desired
position and to pick-up the next data-point. Repeat until done and then release the mouse button.
The second tab shows a 3D hodograph display:

Image 2: The Grid Sounding Control with a 3D Hodograph
The hodograph is enabled if the plotted data includes wind fields. It can be rotated into 3D using the mouse and keyboard combinations. To reset
the hodograph use Ctrl+R .
The third tab shows a table of all values in the sounding:

Image 1: The Grid Sounding Control with a Table of all Sounding Values

Aerological Parameters
The table to the left of the sounding diagram contains aerological parameters determined from the atmospheric sounding displayed in the diagram.
The following abbreviations are used:
LCL
Lifting Condensation Level: the level at which a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel becomes saturated with water-vapor.
LFC
Level of Free Convection: the level at which the virtual temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel changes from being less than
the environment's virtual temperature to being greater than the environment's.
LNB
Level of Neutral Buoyancy: the level above the LFC at which the virtual temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel equals the

environment's virtual temperature.
CAPE
Convective Available Potential Energy: the area between the virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the
virtual temperature trace of the environment from the LFC to the LNB in which the parcel's virtual temperature is greater than the
environment's (positive CAPE connotes convective development).
CIN
Convective Inhibition: the negative of the area between the virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the
virtual temperature trace of the environment from the parcel's initial conditions to the LFC in which the parcel's virtual temperature is less
than the environment's (negative CIN connotes initial positive work to lift the parcel).

Properties
Soundings
When displaying multiple sounding locations, use the pull down menu to select a station to display.
Dry Adiabats
When checked, displays the dry adiabats on the diagram.
Saturation Adiabats
When checked, displays the saturation adiabats on the diagram.
Mixing Ratio
When checked, displays the mixing ratio lines on the diagram.
Parcel Path
When checked, displays the path of a parcel of air lifted pseudo-adiabatically from the initial point to the top of the diagram.
Virtual Temperature
When checked, the virtual temperatures of the environmental profile and pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel are displayed.
Grid Points
When checked, turns on the display of the grid points in the main display.
Stations
Toggle the visibility of the RAOB station location mark in the main display window.
Parcel mode
Use the pull down menu to specify how the initial conditions of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel (i.e. the parcel's pressure,
temperature, and moisture content at the start of the pseudoadiabatic lifting) are determined from the environmental sounding (i.e. the
temperature and dew-point profiles according to the mode indicated. The choices are:
Bottom of Sounding - The initial conditions of the parcel are determined from the temperature and dew-point at the lowest (i.e.
highest pressure).
Below Cursor - The initial conditions of the parcel are determined from the temperature and dew-point profiles by computing the
pressure-weighted mean potential temperature and water-vapor mixing-ratio of the atmosphere that lies below the cursor when the
middle mouse button is pressed. Thus, pressing the middle button at 950 hPa for a sounding that starts at 1000 hPa will effectively mix
the lower 50 hPa of the atmosphere and lift the resulting parcel starting at 975 hPa.
At Cursor Pressure - The initial pressure, in-situ temperature, and moisture content of the parcel are taken from the temperature and
dew-point profiles at the pressure of the cursor when the middle mouse button is pressed. In At Cursor (Press, Temp) mode, the
initial pressure and in-situ temperature of the parcel equal the pressure and temperature values under the cursor when the middle
mouse button is pressed. The initial moisture content is determined from the dew-point profile at the initial pressure.
At Cursor (Press, Temp) - The computed path of a lifted parcel is automatically updated when appropriate. In both Below Cursor,
At Cursor Pressure, and At Cursor (Press, Temp) modes, the path will update as the cursor is dragged. In all modes, the path will
update whenever the profiles change.
Wind spacing
Allows the user to control which wind levels are shown in the display.
Reset Sounding
Reset the temperature and dewpoint profiles back to their original values by selecting Edit->Reset Sounding.
Show U and V
When checked, Speed and Direction values in the table are changed to U and V.

Storm Track Controls
Overview
The Storm Track Control displays tropical storm observation and model output tracks. Currently the McIDAS-V supports both the Automated
Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) data as well as data from the Shanghai Typhoon Institute .
To load in ATCF data select the Tools->Text Data ->ATCF Tropical Storm Data menu. This creates a data source with a predefined path to the
National Hurricane Center ftp site. Then, create the Storm Track display.
The display control shows the set of available storms on the left panel organized by year and basin, e.g., Atlantic (AL), Eastern Pacific (EP) and
Central Pacific (CP).

Year Display
At the top of the list is an option (Yearly Tracks) which allows the user to display the observed tracks for all the storms in a given year. You can
load and/or unload any number of years worth of observed tracks. The color swatch changes the color of the tracks for a given year. The Time
Mode menu allows one to change the animation mode, e.g., use the year or use the storm start time.

Storm Display
To show the observation and all of the model results for a single storm select the storm in the list and press the Load Tracks button. You can load
any number of storms but they are shown in different panels. You can use the View->Storm Tracks menu to list out all of the loaded storms,
remove them all, etc. Once a storm is loaded it can be removed with the small "scissors" icon shown in the upper right.
Once a storm is loaded the first thing you should do is to specify which "Techs" (or models) to use by bringing up the control's Properties dialog
Edit->Properties menu. In the "Techs to use" tab, select all of the Techs in the "Use" list (click and press control-a) and press Remove . This
places them in the "Don't Use" list. Select the desired Techs in the "Don't use" list and press Add. You can also choose what parameters are to be
used and displayed in the "Chart Parameters" tab, repeat the same step to select the desired parameters. If you want these selections to be saved as
a preference, please check the "Save as Preference" box.

The Storm display panel consists of three tabs: Tracks, Table and Storm Chart.

Tracks

The Tracks tab controls the display and animation of the tracks.
The Points menus specify which Layout Model to use for both the Observation as well as the Forecast tracks.
The Animation is the layout model to use for the Observation track that moves along with the time animation.
The Animation Mode determines whether to animate the tracks or show all of the tracks.
Using the Color By menus one can specify whether the track is shown with a fixed color or using a color table. The color table used is a single
one for the entire display control and is set through the main Edit menu.
Under the Show table one can specify what is to be shown. One can toggle on/off the visiblity of the Observation track, all of the forecast tracks
or individual forecast tracks.

Table
The Table tab shows a tabular listing of all of the observational track data and individual forecast model runs. On the left is a tree view organized
by the Tech and model run time. Selecting one of the model runs will display the data in the table. The main File->Save->Export to Spreadsheet
menu allows you to export the track data to an Excel spreadsheet. In the File Dialog are options to select what is to be saved.

Storm Chart
The Storm Chart tab shows time series charts of selected tracks. Under the main Edit menu you can any number of new forecast time or forecast
hour charts. The forecast time chart is based around the model run time of the selected forecasts. The forecast hour charts selects data across the
different model run times, e.g., you can show the 12 hour forecast from each model run.
To do the charting of the storm track, one or more Techs need to be selected. Once selected the Forecast Hour/Forecast Time list is populated.
One or more times can be selected (control-click). Each Parameter that is selected will result in a new chart shown on the right.
The Use Difference button, when selected, results in the display of the difference between the forecast value and the observed value.

Scatter Analysis Controls
Overview
The Scatter Analysis controls are used to create a scatter plot within McIDAS-V. The scatter controls show three different panels:

The plot on the left represents the first field selected, the plot in the middle represents the second field and the plot on the right is the scatter
analysis of the two fields. The first field selected is represented on the x-axis (abscissa) and the second field selected represents the y-axis
(ordinate). The x-axis is selected in the Field Selector - what you have selected in the lower right Channels tab will be used as the x-axis.
The scatter plot and images can be analyzed by highlighting a box or region in either display. To draw a box, click the “Box” radio button, select
one of the colored boxes (magenta, blue, green) to the right of the radio buttons, and use the Shift+Left click and drag option to draw a box over a
region of the scatter plot. The corresponding points in the image will be highlighted. Conversely, one can select a region of interest in one of the
images and then the corresponding points in the scatter plot will be highlighted. To select your own shape, click the “Curve” radio button, a color,
and use the Left Click and drag option to draw an enclosed shape. Currently, you are allowed one box or curve per color for the scatter plot and
one for the images.
To change the color bar or other color bar properties, right click to access a popup menu.

McIDAS-X Bridge Controls
Overview
The McIDAS-X Bridge Controls are used to create and import a McIDAS-X session into McIDAS-V. The control window has two tabs. The first
includes a pseudo duplicate of the two main McIDAS-X windows:

The second shows the settings for this display control:

Vertical cross sections can be made in three types of displays, with contour lines, color-filled contours, and as a color-shaded image.

Properties
Command Line
McIDAS-X commands can be entered through the "Command Line" text entry box at the bottom of the Layer Controls tab. Interactive
commands are not implemented. Recall commands (Shift+6 and Shift+7) do work in the bridge session.
Smooth images
When checked, anti-aliasing will be used to smooth images when resizing to fit the frame display.
Time Animation Controls

Controls looping of displays when more than one data time is loaded. See more in Time Animation Control.
Color Table
The control has a color bar showing the active color table and the associated high and low data values in the units the display is made in. As
the mouse pointer is moved over the color bar, the value at a particular color is shown. Click on the color bar to start the Color Table Editor.
Or click on the button that displays the name of the color table to show a popup menu that allows you to change the range, select other color
tables, etc.
Vertical Position
This slider allows you to set the vertical position of the image.
Pixel Sampling
Adjust the Pixel Sampling slider to change the resolution of the image. A larger number makes a lower resolution (coarser) display.
Texture Quality
Use the slider to change the texture quality of the display.
Display data in the main 3D panel
When checked images, graphics, and/or annotation lines from navigated frames in the McIDAS-X Bridge session will be imported into the
main 3D panel in McIDAS-V. Non navigated frames are not imported into McIDAS-V and will be skipped.
Use McIDAS-X frame order to override data time with frame number
When checked, navigated data will be imported into McIDAS-V based upon their order within the McIDAS-X frame order instead of by
time.
Use McIDAS-X data projection
When checked, the default data projection from McIDAS-X will be used when displayed navigated data in the main 3D panel in McIDASV. When unchecked, the McIDAS-V default data projection will be used.

Range and Bearing Controls
Overview
The Range and Bearing Controls show the distance, azimuth, and back azimuth of a great circle line connecting two positions on the Earth's
surface.

When the range and bearing controls are first created a range and bearing line is added to the main view window. The distance and azimuth
values are shown on the Legend in the main view window, and at the top of the range and bearing control window. The latitude-longitude position
values of the end points are also shown. Computations are based on the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid, using computation code from the U.S.
National Geodetic Survey.
Note The line shown on the display is not the great circle path connecting the end points. The values are computed for a great circle path on the
ellipsoidal earth, using the numerical latitude and longitude values, not the line on the display. The line shown in the display is a straight line on
whatever map projection you happen to have; usually it will not coincide with the great circle line.
Note If you change the map projection, an existing range and bearing map line will stay at the same location in the display, hence the end points
on the map are in new locations. The distance, azimuth, etc. values in the control window reflect the latitude-longitude positions in the control
window and hence do not match the display picture until an end point is moved by hand.

Properties
Positioning the line
You can re-position the end points of the line in the display by dragging the end points with the left mouse button, or by selecting positions
from the pull-down menus. You can change what pre-defined positions are used with the Edit->Set Locations menu.
You can move the entire set of selector line and both end points at once by dragging mouse pointer on the the square at the center of the
line. The orientation across the display is maintained while the line moves.
End points
You can enter the latitude and longitude values of either end point of a line. Click in the text window of "From:" or "To" as to which
value(s) you want to save. Use the backspace key to remove unwanted numbers, and enter the new values. Clicking Apply or pressing the
Enter key will move the end point of the line to the new position, and show the new distance and azimuth values. You can also select a state
from the pull down tab.
Vertical Position
This slider allows you to set the vertical position of the range and bearing line.
Selector Color
Change the color of the range and bearing line by using the Edit->Selector Color menu.
Change Display Unit
Change the unit used to display the distance by using the Edit->Change Display Unit menu.

Drawing Controls
Overview
The drawing controls consists of a drawing editor that supports polygons, lines, shapes and text. It behaves like other two-dimensional drawing
editors - you can choose the tool to use (e.g., move, create graphic, etc.), apply the tool in the main 3D window, select graphic objects, etc.
A caveat: drawing and selecting in 3D is at times tricky. Sometimes it is best to be in the main overhead view.
The user interface consists of three tabs. The first allows for the user to set the drawing mode:

The second sets the drawing style:

And the third lists all of the graphical elements:

Double clicking on an element will show its properties editor through which you can change its color, line width, position, etc.

Image 1: Shape Properties
Note: The drawing control will only respond to events (e.g., mouse drag to draw) when its window is being show. For example, if it is not visible
in the Data Explorer tab then no drawing will take place.
The distance and area of a shape will be shown when it is being drawn, in the Shapes list and in the shape properties. You can change the distance
unit through the Edit->Change Display Unit... menu.

Properties
Mode
There are three editing modes, select, move and reshape:
Allows you to select one or more drawing objects. To select multiples press the control key. The selected objects will be shown
with small magenta rectangles. Once selected you can bring up the object's property editor by pressing Control-P. You can also delete
the selected objects by pressing Control-X. You can select all of the objects by pressing Control-A.
A caveat: Some objects can only be selected by clicking on or near certain points. Rectangles and diamonds click near the upper left
or lower right. For text click near the beginning of the text string for left justified text, near the center for center justified text or near
the end for right justified text.
Allows you to move an object.
Allows you to move one of the points that define the location of an object.
Enabled
This checkbox allows you to disable/enable drawing. For example, if you wanted to manipulate other elements in the display (e.g., probe
point, cross section, other drawing controls), you can disable the drawing control so that it does not respond to any mouse events in the main
display.
Shapes
The shape buttons allow you to create:
Click and drag in the main display to create a smooth polygon. Check the Straight checkbox, then click and drag to create a
straight line polygon.
,
Click and drag in the main display to create the shape.
Click in the main display and type to enter text. When done entering text hit
Click in the main display to create a waypoint - text and a shape.
Click in the main display to create an image. Select an image file from the file chooser. Note: drawing with the image is a bit
flaky. The Full Lat/Lon button controls how the corners of the image are positioned.
Click in the main display to create a movie. Select a movie file from the file chooser. Note: drawing with the movie is a bit flaky.
Click in the main display to create a symbol.
Fronts - The drawing control also supports drawing a number of front and high/low symbols:
Click in the main display to create a high pressure symbol.
Click in the main display to create a low pressure symbol.
Click and drag in the main display to create a cold front.
Click and drag in the main display to create a warm front.
Click and drag in the main display to create an occluded front.
Click and drag in the main display to create a stationary front.
Click and drag in the main display to create a trough.
While the icon buttons only allow you to draw 5 different front types, there are 20+ front types to choose from in the Properties
dialog for the shape.
Location
The drawing control allows you to draw in four different coordinate systems:
Lat/Lon/Alt - The points of the shapes are defined by Latitude/Longitude/Altitude. When you reproject the display the shape will also
be reprojected.
Lat/Lon - Like Lat/Lon/Alt but the z position is fixed using the Z Position slider.
X/Y/Z - Draw in the 3D box coordinate space. Re-projections will no effect the shape.
X/Y - Like X/Y/Z but the z position is fixed.
For now the Full Lat/Lon is not fully implemented.

Z Position
Allows you to define what is the fixed Z position.
Time
If you have the Draw in current time checkbox turned on then the graphic shapes that that you are drawing will only be shown in the
current animation time in the 3D view. This facility allows you to, for example, annotate features through time by drawing on the feature,
stepping the time animation, and then drawing in the next time. To see all of the objects irrespective of their display times select the Show
all checkbox.
A graphic can be shown in more than one times using the property editor. Select the object and press Control-P to bring up the property
editor. Select the times to be displayed in in the Times list (Shift-click or Control-click to select multiples) and press Apply or Ok .
Color, Line Width, etc.
These widgets allow you to define the color, line width, font, and text justification.
Edit Menu
There is a "Remove All" entry in the edit menu that removes all graphic objects from the display.
File Menu
Under the file menu you can choose to export the objects in the drawing control. This creates a simple xml file (a .xgrf file suffix) that
defines the objects and that can be re-imported.

Transect Drawing Controls
Overview
The transect drawing controls are a version of the Drawing Controls that allows you to view, create and modify the transect lines that are used in
the Transect Views.

This display is either created through the Display->Draw Transect menu or through the Transects menu in the Transect View.
This display control is a representation of the set of transects that are defined by the transect resource. Not only does it have its own state (that can
be saved in a bundle for example) it also writes out any transects you may create or change into your local McIDAS-V state directory in a
transects.xml file.
In this control there is only one shape that you can draw with, the Transect Line. This control also shows a non-editable Transect Shape which
displays the full transect line used by any Transect Views. We call these the "Active Transects". There are also a set of transect lines that are noneditable that are from the system transects property.
For an active transect, if the Transect View that it represents has a max distance set then the transect will show this max distance as a rectangular
box.

Properties
Mode
Click and drag in the main display to create a transect.
There are three editing modes, select, move and reshape:
Allows you to select one or more transect drawings. To select multiples press the control key. The selected transects will be
shown with small magenta rectangles. Once selected you can bring up the transect's property editor by pressing Control-P. You can
also delete the selected objects by pressing Control-X. You can select all of the objects by pressing Control-A.
Allows you to move a transect.
Allows you to move one of the points that define the end points of a transect.

Web Map Server(WMS)/Background Image Controls
Overview
The WMS Controls display imagery from WMS servers. A set of predefined links to WMS servers for topographic, shaded relief and aerial
imagery is also provided with the Background Image control.
To use the pre-defined Background images, select the Display->Add Background Image menu item. To choose imagery from web map servers
bring up the Data Source Chooser , go to the Catalogs tab and enter the url that points to the Capabilities document of the desired WMS. We also
provide links to a set of useful WMSs from the idvcatalog. If it is not in the Catalog pull down menu simply enter the url:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/georesources/idvcatalog.xml
From this catalog open the Web Map Servers tab and select the WMS you would like to access.
The WMS Controls makes a request to the Web Map Server for an image that covers the area currently being displayed in the main display. Due
to the time it takes to access remote servers the WMS Control does not request new images when the user pans and zooms.

Properties
Layer
If multiple layers have been selected (using control-click in the WMS Chooser or in the Background Image control) you can choose which
layer to view with this menu.
Image Buttons
Click to reload the image from the server at the current screen location.
Click to set the projection in the display to the current image bounds.
When the Auto-Reload button is selected, the WMS control will automatically fetch a new image every time the main display is panned or
zoomed. There is a slight delay so that successive zooms do not cause successive image requests.
Resolution
The Resolution menu allows you to make requests for lower resolution images. This results in a smaller image file size and quicker
requests from the server.
Vertical Position
This slider allows you to set the vertical position of the image.
Transparency
You can adjust the overall transparency of the image. Note: Some Web Map Servers provide images that contain transparent sections.
Currently, McIDAS-V does not support the display of transparent sections.
Dimension Scale
By default the bounds of the image that is retrieved from the server is the size of the display. This slider allows you to fetch an even larger
image.
Save as Image Xml/Kml File
This is available under the File->Save menu. It takes the most recently displayed image and writes it out (e.g., as a jpeg file) and also
writes out McIDAS-V's ximg xml file that contains the reference to the image file and the lat/lon position of the image.
This allows the user to load this image back in without being connected to the original web map server.
If a .kml or .kmz file suffix is given then the Google Earth file is created and the image can be loaded into Google Earth.

Jython Controls
Overview
The Jython Controls allow for the development of custom layer controls written in Jython. The controls operate in two modes.
First is the "developer" mode. Here the developer can create a Jython Control; specify the name of the display, any data categories, and the probe
type; and write the Jython that creates a GUI and responds to data, animation time and probe position changes.
The default Jython code has examples of accessing data, etc.
The second mode is "user" mode. In developer mode you can write out an specification of the Jython Control to a plugin through the File->Save>Write to Plugin menu. This plugin, when loaded, will only show the user interface that is created by the developer-written Jython.

Weather Text Product Control
Overview
This control is used to display weather text products (forecasts, warnings, watches, etc) produced by the National Weather Service and other
international meteorological agencies.
The user interface consists of 3 tabs. The first allows the user to select and display the text products. The Products panel allows the user to select
the type of product to view. When a product is selected, the available stations are plotted in the associated view window. One or more stations can
be selected by clicking on the station in the view window (or Ctrl-click for multiple stations). When a station is selected, the text product for that
station is displayed.

The user can select between displaying the products as raw text or as HTML by clicking on the tab at the bottom of the text display area.
In the HTML view, you can toggle on a glossary which will highlight certain meteorological terms. When the links are clicked, a dialog will pop
up with an explanation of the term.

By default, the most recent text product is displayed. Multiple products can be displayed by selecting a time range from the Time Covered
selector. You can loop through multiple products using the Time Animation widget. The time animation will be synched with any other data in the
associated view window.
The second tab controls the display of the station locations in the associated View window. It is the same as the Station Location Control's
Display tab.

When you select a product, the available stations are shown in the View window. This tab can be used to control the station density and the layout
of the station identifiers.
The third tab lists information about the selected location and shows lists of all the locations and the displayed selections.

It is the same as the Locations tab in the Station Location Control.

Charts
Overview
A number of the layer controls make use of a charting facility. The charts have a common set of properties and facilities. Each of these layer
controls will show a thumbnail image of their charts in the legend. This can be toggled using the View->Chart->Show Chart Thumbnail option.
There are four levels of configuration available to the user.

Chart Line Properties
At the lowest level you can set the properties of how each parameter or field is shown. This is done through the Chart Line properties dialog
which is brought up typically through the View->Chart menu or by right clicking on the fields table.

Chart Layout
When you have multiple charts you can define different layouts for them using the View->Chart->Layout menu. There are a number of predefined layouts: Vertical, Horizontal, 2 Column, 3 Column, Tabs. The Grid Layout allows for much flexibility in how the charts are organized and
laid out. The View->Chart->Layout->Change Grid Layout menu brings up the Grid Layout Editor:

The idea here is the overall window is divided up into a number of rows and columns. You can add/remove rows and columns with the "+" and "" buttons. You can then drag the little graphical representations of the charts to place them in the grid. A chart can also span multiple rows or
columns. Just grab the little black square on one side of the chart image and drag it to change the row or column.

The Data Sources tab allows you to define what types of data choosers to use. This is a way to simplify the Data Explorer window, only showing
those tabs that you want to use. You can either select to "Use all data sources " or "Use selected data sources " and select individual choosers to
use.

User Preferences - ADDE Server Manager
The ADDE Server Manager is currently managed through the Edit->Preferences menu under the "ADDE Servers" tab and allows you to add and
manage your list of servers.

Image 1: ADDE Server Manager
The ADDE Server Manager allows you to add and manage a list of ADDE servers separated by data type and removes the need to manually enter
in each server and group information, as well as the need to enter in logon information (if required). To turn all servers on/off in the data
choosers, click the All on/All of button.
To add a server to the manager, click the Add button to bring up a dialog box with the following properties:
Server: Enter in a server name or IP address.
Dataset(s): Enter in a group or set of group names. To add multiple groups, separate each with a comma.
Need accounting information Check if the server being added requires a logon and project number.
User ID: If the Need accounting information box is checked, enter in the user ID to logon to the server.
Project # If the Need accounting information box is checked, enter in the project number used to logon to the server.

Add Click to add all checked data types to the server manager. No verification of the data types will be performed.
To delete a server from the list, left click on one or more server/dataset entry and click Delete.
The Import from McIDAS-X button allows you to import MCTABLE.TXT from a McIDAS-X session. McIDAS-V requires server verification
in order for the servers to be listed in the proper choosers under the proper data source type. When Verify imported servers is checked, the
automatic server verification checks the availability of each data type on each server in your text file and imports the available servers into your
server list. Disabling the automatic server verification will still import the servers, but will list them as Unverified in the ADDE Server Manager.
In order to manually verify the servers and have them listed in the data choosers, you will need to use the ADDE Server Manager to individually
edit the servers to define their appropriate data type.
The Import from URL button allows you to import a XML file containing a list of ADDE servers into McIDAS-V.
The server manager can filter the list of servers depending upon the source. Use the following checkboxes to turn on and off specific sets of

Probe Format. This defines an html template that is used to display data readouts in the data probe display. This html template can contain
macros that are replaced with the probed values. Macros are:
%value% Formatted value
%unit% Display unit
%rawvalue% Unformatted value
%rawunit% Original unit
Distance Unit . When displaying distances (e.g., in the Range and Bearing Control) this is the default unit that is used.
Sampling Mode . You can specify the type of sampling you want for the various data probes. Choose between a weighted average sampling or
nearest neighbor.
Pressure to Height . You can specify the type of algorithm you want to use for converting from pressure coordinates to height. See the FAQ for
more information on this option.
Cache Data in Memory. McIDAS-V normally tries to cache data that it loads in memory. You can turn this behavior off with a preference.
Disk Cache Size. McIDAS-V will cache some data sets to disk to eliminate network latency. Specify the maximum amount of disk size with this
preference.
Max Image Size. This field allows you to set a maximum image size (in pixels) that is to be displayed. When this preference is set the image
display will adjust the Pixel Sampling to reduce the image to less than the preferred value. This allows for the initial display of large images
without causing memory issues.
Grid Threshold . This field allows you to set a size limit for holding grids in memory. Grids larger than this size will be cached to disk instead of
held in memory during the McIDAS-V session. This allows loading large grids and long loops of grids without a major performance hit.

User Preferences - Advanced
The Advanced tab lets you change options that require a restart in order for them to take effect. This tab is also accessed by using the startup
manager to configure settings before running McIDAS-V (runMcV-Config.bat or runMcV-Config).

Image 1: Advanced Preferences
Memory. Change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V to use either a percentage or a set value. The new amount of memory will be saved
and used in subsequent sessions. For 32 bit operating systems, it is recommended to set this to no more than 1250 MB. The maximum value for 32
bit operating systems is 1536 MB.
Enable 3D controls . When checked, McIDAS-V uses the default 3D behavior. Uncheck to override the default 3D behavior of McIDAS-V and
use a 2D View for Map Views.
Enable JOGL. Choose to use or not use Java OpenGL (JOGL).
Enable Direct3D . Windows-only: choose to use or not use Direct3D.
Specify Default Bundle. When checked, select a bundle from your list of favorites (found in the Bundles menu) to load upon startup.
Load Default Layout. When checked, McIDAS-V will load the default layout upon startup. Uncheck to use the default layout of McIDAS-V
(one window with one panel).
Enable Geometry by Reference . Choose to use or not use Java Geometry by Reference. Try this option unchecked if random/extraneous map
lines are drawn - a problem that may occur more frequently on systems with ATI graphics cards.
Enable Concurrent Mark-Sweep Garbage Collector . Choose to use or not use Java Concurrent Mark-Sweep Garbage Collector.
Enable Non-Power of Two (NPOT) Textures . Choose to use or not use Java Non-Power of Two (NPOT) Textures.
Enable Access to Image Data by Reference . Choose to use or not use Java Access to Image Data by Reference. We recommend that this option
be checked, as it often removes the jagged edges at the limb and/or gaps at the dateline that sometimes appear in displays of image data.
Java Rendering. Use the pull down menu to select the number of Java threads to use for rendering.

Remote ADDE Data Manager
The Local and Remote ADDE Data Managers are available through the Tools->Manage ADDE Datasets menu. Click the "Remote Data" tab to
manage access to data on other workstations, or the "Local Data" tab to manage access to data on your workstation. Continue below for more
information about the Remote ADDE Data Manager, or go here for more information about the Local ADDE Data Manager.

Image 1: Remote ADDE Data Manager
The Remote ADDE Data Manager lets you add, delete or edit access to remote datasets that are available through the Data Explorer. You can also
import a MCTABLE.TXT file that contains a preexisting set of entries for the Remote ADDE Data Manager.
The columns in the main table are defined below.
Valid:
An empty column (no icon) means that the entry passed a verification check (the specified dataset and data type exists on the server) when it
was added. A sad-face icon ( ) indicates that the entry failed the verification check and thus will not work if you attempt to access data
from the dataset.
Source:
Indicates the source of the entry. System entries ( ) are ones supplied in the McIDAS-V package and thus are not editable. User entries (
) are ones that were added by the user and thus are editable. MCTABLE entries ( ) are ones that were added by importing
MCTABLE.TXT file and are also editable.
Dataset:
Lists the server IP address and dataset name for the entry. When you access the dataset (by pressing the "Connect" button in the Data
Explorer), an ADDE request is sent to the server, which then returns the requested data.
Accounting:
Indicates whether the entry includes accounting information (username and project number) for the server. These are the values specified in
the Username and Project # fields in the Define New Remote Dataset window that appears when the "Add New Dataset" button is
clicked. If accounting information was not specified, then the Accounting field entry says "public dataset".
Data Types:
Indicates the values that were selected in the Dataset Types section in the Define New Remote Dataset window that appears when the
"Add New Dataset" button is clicked.
The four buttons at the bottom of the window are described in the corresponding section below.
Add New Dataset
Edit Dataset
Remove Selection

The window below appears if you click the
ADDE Data Manager window.

button or select the File->New Remote Dataset menu in the main Remote

Image 2: Define New Remote Dataset window
The Define New Remote Dataset window lets you add access to remote datasets so they are available through the Data Explorer.
The fields and buttons are defined below.
Server:
Enter the IP address of the server workstation.
Dataset:
Enter the ADDE dataset name. In McIDAS-X, this is often called the ADDE group name.
Specify accounting information:
If the server uses ADDE accounting to require users to enter a username and project number to access the dataset, click this checkbox to
enable text entry into those fields. If the dataset is a public dataset, meaning that the server allows users to access the dataset without
specifying a username and project number, then leave this box unchecked. If you are unsure whether it's a public dataset or one that requires
a username and project number, click the "Verify Server" button and the Status field will say "Incorrect accounting information" if it's
required.
Username and Project #:
If you've been granted access to a dataset on a server that uses ADDE accounting to limit access to specific users, click the "Specify
accounting information" checkbox then enter your username and project number for that server. The valid usernames and project numbers
for each server are assigned and maintained by the server administrator.
Dataset Types:
Click the checkboxes for each of the types of data in the dataset. To find which types are available, click the "Verify Server" button and it
will check the box of each available type.
Status:
Indicates the status and provides instructions.
First completes the procedure listed in the Verify Server section below. Then, if everything is passes the verification tests, it adds a new
entry to the Remote ADDE Data Manager containing the information specified in this window.
Contacts the server and verifies whether the dataset exists. If so, it also verifies which dataset types it contains and, if a username and
project number is required, whether the specified ones are valid.
Adds a new entry to the Remote ADDE Data Manager containing the information specified in this window. This option does not do any
verification testing, so it's possible to add an incorrect dataset name, username, project number, etc.
Closes the window and discards any information that was entered.
If you highlight an editable entry then click the
button in the main Remote ADDE Data Manager window, the window and
fields are the same as above, except that the window title is Edit Remote Dataset and the bottom buttons say Verify and Save Changes, Verify
Changes, and Save Changes (rather than Verify and Add Server, Verify Server, and Add Server).

If you highlight an editable entry then click the
button in the main Remote ADDE Data Manager window, it immediately
removes the entry from the table. There is no recovery option, so if you accidentally remove an entry you need, you will have to remake the entry
using the "Add New Dataset" button.

The window below appears if you click the

button in the main Remote ADDE Data Manager window.

Image 3: Import MCTABLE window
The Import MCTABLE window lets you import a MCTABLE.TXT file that contains a preexisting set of entries for the Remote ADDE Data
Manager. For example, McIDAS-X users may have added access to many servers via the DATALOC command. Those entries are stored in the
MCTABLE.TXT file, which can be imported to McIDAS-V.
The fields and buttons are defined below.

Projection Manager
The Projection Manager allows you to choose, edit and save map projections for use in McIDAS-V.
A projection is a way of mapping the surface of the earth (a curved 2D surface) onto a plane (a flat 2D surface). A projection transforms a point
on the earth (specified by latitude, longitude) to a point on the projection plane .
In the Projection Manager, both the projection - - which kind of mapping to use -- and the area of the Earth can be specified. You can make a
Lambert Conformal map of North America, and a Lambert Conformal map of Sedgwick County, Kansas. Same projection, different areas.
McIDAS-V provides several basic types of projections: Lat/Lon , Lambert Conformal, Transverse Mercator, Stereographic, , Mercator,
Albers Equal Area, Lambert Azimuth Equal Area, Orthographic , Vertical Perspective View. Each of these can be parameterized (e.g.,
tangent point, origin longitude) to create a specific projection area of that type. When you define a projection and area, you specify the type of
projection and its parameters.

Projection Manager Window
You can bring up the Projection Manager with the Projections->New/Edit menu option, or through the Tools->Projections->Edit Map
Projections . Projections supplied with McIDAS-V are shown in the list. There may be additional projections you have created and named. In the
figure, the McIDAS-V US->CONUS projection is highlighted, and displayed on the left.

Image 1: Projection Manager
To use a projection in the application: select it from the list by clicking on the name (it turns blue), and press Apply which leaves the projection
manager on screen, or press Ok and the projection manager is removed.
To modify or create a new projection: choose Edit or New from the menu; the Define/Edit Projection dialog box appears (see below).
McIDAS-V starts with a default projection. Use the Default pull-down menu to select the projection that will be shown each time your McIDASV starts. (The default projection may not be used if you are starting McIDAS-V with a Bundle of configuration information.)
You can also Export a projection to a file.
You can remove any projection from the main list by clicking on its name to highlight it, and then clicking on the Delete button.

Define/Edit Projection Window
This allows you to define new projections, and to modify existing ones. Remember that a Projection not only consists of the mathematical
projection, but also the area of the Earth that is seen.
Here is how to create a new or revised projection:
Choose Edit or New from Projection Manager Window.
Choose a Projection Type from the pull-down menu.
Fill in the projection parameters.
Set the map area shown with this named projection by zooming and panning the view on the left. To zoom, drag the left mouse button. Use
the other buttons in the window to zoom out and move around.
Give it a new or revised name if necessary. See the Properties section below for more information about naming and creating hierarchies.

Introduction
The Color Table Editor supports editing existing color tables and creating new ones. A color table is an ordered collection of colors that is used to
color a display according to a range of data values.

Starting the Color Table Editor
The Color Table Editor can be used stand-alone by selecting the Tools->Color Tables menu item from the main menu bar. It can also be used or
in conjunction with a particular display by clicking on the display's color bar in the legend, or through the display's edit menu. When used in
conjunction with a particular display the changes you make to the color table are applied to the display as you make them. To turn this off use the
Auto Update check box in the lower right corner of the window.
The Color Table Editor starts with a color table loaded in it. If you are working with a data display, the color table in the editor is the same as in
the display. If you want to use or edit a different color table, use the Color Tables menu to select from the categorized list of color tables:

Color tables are grouped into categories, as illustrated. The illustration shows the color tables for the "Basic" category. Click on a category and
then on a "color table to select.
To switch to the newly selected color table for a display on screen, click on OK in the bottom of the Color Table Editor, and the editor will close,
or click on Apply to keep the editor in use. If Auto Update is checked the change takes place without further action by you, as soon as you select
a new color table.

Color Legend

The color table is shown in the bar of color across the window, the color legend. How many colors are in the table is shown in a label in the upper
center, such as "135 colors." You can reduce or increase the number of colors by clicking on the - /+ choices near the left and right ends of the
legend. New colors are added or removed at each end of the legend with the same color as the end color. Pressing Shift-Click on any of these
buttons will add/remove 10 color slots at a time.
Underneat the color legend is a black and white checker board to help show the degree of transparency. Most color tables have zero transparency
and the checker board is not visible.
The History undo/redo buttons in the upper left allow you to step forward and backward through the changes you have made. Pressing ShiftClick on these buttons will step forward/back 10 changes.
The spectrum of colors spans a range of data values. The values are shown at the ends of the color legends. You can change the max and min of
the range with the Range: pair of dialog boxes on the right. Enter the minimum and maximum values of the range you need, and click Apply or
Ok, or press the Enter key. If the Color Table Editor is being used in conjunction with a display then when you change the range that range is
applied to the display as well.

Painting and Editing Colors
You can "paint" in the color bar by just dragging the mouse within it. When your mouse is over the color bar the cursor will change to a
paintbrush and a gray line is drawn to indicate the position of the cursor.
The type of painting is specified by the Paint Mode buttons.
Fill . When you drag the slider, it will fill the color table with the currently selected color in the color chooser.
Interpolate . Apply a linear interpolation from where you started dragging the breakpoint to the color value of where the breakpoint is
currently located while dragging.
Transparency. Apply the given transparency value (in the editable pull-down menu) to the color table where you are dragging the
breakpoint.

Breakpoints
The editor uses "breakpoints" indicated along the top of the color legend bar with little triangles and a number. Clicking on a break point makes it
active. The number on an active breakpoint is in bold characters. There is only one active breakpoint at a time. Making a new breakpoint makes
the new breakpoint active.
Breakpoints are used for a number of things: showing the data and transparency values at a point along the color table and changing the colors
(fill, interpolation or transparency) directly below the breakpoint by dragging the breakpoint and changing colors through a popup menu.
The values on the breakpoints are determined by the position of the breakpoint along the legend, proportional to the min and max of the Range.
Changing the minimum and maximum of the Range changes the break point values.
You can move the active breakpoint several ways:
Drag on it with the mouse pointer;
Move in small increments with the right or left arrow keys. (If there is no response, first mouse click on the breakpoint.)
Move in bigger steps with the shift-arrow keys.
Right-click on the breakpoint and use the pop-up menu item Change Breakpoint .
If you have the "Actively set color" checkbox selected, when you change the color in the color chooser at the bottom that color will be applied to
the color slot under the selected breakpoint. This allows you to set the color of a specific color slot.
You can also change colors and manipulate breakpoints using a right mouse click popup menu on a breakpoint:

The choices are:
Remove Breakpoint .
Remove the active breakpoint.
Lock/Unlock Breakpoint
Lock of unlock the active breakpoint.
Change Breakpoint .
Set the breakpoint to a new value.
Add Breakpoint->Here.
Add a new breakpoint where the legend was clicked.
Add Breakpoint->At Data Point .
Add a new breakpoint at a data value. You will be given a dialog box to enter the value in.
Add Breakpoint->At Beginning .
Add a new breakpoint on the left end.
Add Breakpoint->At End .
Add a new breakpoint on right end.
Edit Colors-> Interpolate Left .
Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, interpolate colors to the left up to the next breakpoint.
Edit Colors->Interpolate Right .
Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, interpolate colors to the right up to the next breakpoint.
Edit Colors->Fill Left .
Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, fill colors to the left up to the next breakpoint with that single color.
Edit Colors->Fill Right .
Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, fill colors to the right up to the next breakpoint with that single color.
Edit Colors->Transparency Left .
All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the left are set with the transparency value.
Edit Colors->Transparency Right .
All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the right get the transparency value.
Edit Colors->Brightness Left .
All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the left are set with the brightness value.
Edit Colors->Brightness Right .
All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the right get the brightness value.
Replicate Color Table
A dialog box will pop up asking how many times the color table should be replicated. It then replicates your current color table that many
times (i.e. If you have a color table with 100 slots and enter 3, the resulting color table will look like 4 of the original color tables, each with
25 slots).
Invert Color Table
Reverses the order of the color table.

Saving, Importing and Exporting
You can modify an existing color table, or edit an existing color table and save it with a new name to make a new color table. Any new or
modified color table can be saved for future use.
To save a new or modified color table simply select the the File->Save menu item or Save button. To save a modified color table as a new color
table, select File->Save As and enter the new name in the dialog box that appears. This new color table will now be permanently saved in your
local collection of color tables.
To save a color table as a file which can be shared with others in their McIDAS-V, select the File->Export menu item. A file dialog will appear
that will allow you to save the color table as an XML-format file. We suggest you use a file extension of .xidvct.
To use a color table as a file which has been supplied to you by another McIDAS-V user, select the File->Import menu item. A file dialog will
appear that will allow you to find the color table as an XML-format file. The following types of color tables can be imported:
McIDAS-V (IDV) color tables (*.xml)
GEMPAK color tables (*.tbl)
McIDAS-X color tables (*.ET)
3-column RGB color table (*.ascii)
3-column RGB color table
The definitions of the 3-column RGB color table are divided over a range of values. Each line represents one of the equal sized blocks on the color
bar. If there are ten lines in the file, they show up on the color bar as ten equal-sized blocks, with the first line's color being applied to the first
block, the second line's color applied to the second, etc. Currently, there needs to be five or more lines in the file in order for the color table to
work.

Color Chooser

Image 1: The Color Chooser, HSB panel
The Color Chooser, in the lower half of the Color Table Editor window, allows you to select any possible color.
There are two tabs on the chooser, HSB and RGB, each with its own control panels. The RGB panel shows a window that lets you specify any
color by slider bars for R, G, and B values. R, G, and B are red-green-blue settings that control the intensity of the color guns in a CRT. The only
color sample of an RGB value is the color of the active breakpoint in the legend, which can be pretty small and hard to see clearly. Also, RGB
values are not intuitive -- to get yellow you mix equal amounts of red and green in RGB. We recommend you use the HSB chooser panel unless
you have specific RGB values to set.
The HSB Chooser
The HSB chooser allows you to control color by hue, saturation, and brightness, thereby making any color. With the HSB panel and tab shown,
click on one of the circles marked H , S , or B for the corresponding control for hue, saturation, or brightness.
Hue is the term indicating a pure color selection from the spectrum. Saturation is an indication of how much white is added to the hue. 100%
saturation is pure hue with no white. Brightness is an indication of how much black is added to the hue. 100% brightness has no black and
maximum brilliancy, but can be any saturation from the hue to pure white. 0% brightness is solid black.
Some "colors" are not found in the spectrum and are a mixture of a hue and black or white or both black and white. For example, brown is redorange and some black. Grays are any hue with low saturation and some degree of brightness from black to white -- basically a mixture of white
and black.
You need only use one of the controls for H, S, or B to make any color. It's merely a matter of which one is easiest for you. Often the H control is
the easiest and most intuitive to use. We often think first in terms of colors (hues), and next in terms of how pale or dark a color of that hue we
want. The H control works that way. You can select any possible color with the HSB color chooser in the H setting.
All this is easier to understand while using the HSB panel, with H clicked on:

Image 2: The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high S and high B
The slider bar chooses the pure hue. Once you have chosen a hue, clicking or dragging the mouse on the square color display chooses degrees of
saturation and brightness -- how much white or black is added in -- for that hue. Using the HSB Hue display you can make any color after a little
practice.
Note that the right edge of every hue chooser is a gray scale, and the bottom is pure black.
The Saturation Chooser (S) has a slider bar with the full range of saturation (how much white is added to the color):

Image 3: The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green
Select hue and brightness by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom is always solid black. If you want true shades of colors -pure hue with only black and no white -- use the S control with the slider at the top. There are no grays or pale colors in this case.

The Brightness Chooser (B) has a slider bar with the full range of brightness (how much black is added to the color):

Image 4: The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green
Select hue and saturation by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom is always pale gray going to white. If you want to use colors
that are all at full brightness, use the B control with the slider at the top. Note that colors such as brown are not available in this setting, and there
are no dark colors.
All controls in the HSB panel show the RGB values for any color selected, in case you need to know the RGB values for another use.

Layout Model Editor
The Layout Model Editor composes the layout and style used to plot data on a map from observations at discrete points (e.g., weather
observations).
The Layout Model Editor is used to edit existing models or to create new models. The Editor is opened with the Tools->Station Model Template
menu.

Image 1: Layout Model Editor
To see any model, use the Layout Models menu. The models that the user has edited or created will have "(local)" after the name.
The display shows a horizontal line and a vertical line through the observation location. These axis lines give a reference point. A station model
consists of a set of shapes which are added by clicking on an item in the left column and then clicking where you want to place it (relative to the
observation center point or location point). It will appear with a surrounding outline box and 8 control points you can drag to resize the item.
When a shape is created its property dialog is shown (described below).
Shapes can be moved by dragging with the mouse. Click on any item with the right mouse button to see a pop-up menu of choices to control its
appearance. You can delete an item, set its color, or change font sizes, view its properties, etc.
Each item has a single red "Alignment point" that is used for to locate the actual displays with respect to the center point of the observation. So,
for example, say you want a text label (whose actual width in the main display depends on the data it is showing) to be aligned so that its upper
right corner is at the latitude of the observation and a little right. You would set the shape's alignment point to be "NW" and then position the
shape so that the Y of the alignment point is on the X-axis and the X of the point is a bit right of center.
The Center menu in the popup-menu allows you to center the alignment point vertically and horizontally.
You can also align a collection of shapes. First select the shapes (shift-click). Then select one of the six alignment icons under the top menu bar;
the left most icon means align all the selected items under a horizontal line.
To save a station model you have composed, use the File->Save or File->Save As... menu items. When you save a station model any point data
displays that are using it will be updated. To remove a model, use the File->Remove menu item. You cannot remove a model supplied with
McIDAS-V, but you can remove local models.
You use the Properties choice in the pop-up menu to show the properties dialog window for that shape. The properties dialog is made up of a
number of tabs.
Note: The Apply and OK buttons applies the properties to the shape in the editor. The OK and Cancel buttons closes this dialog. The
Save button does and apply and also saves the station model as a whole (just like doing File->Save ). When the station model is saved
then any displays that are using it are updated. The Save button allows you to see what your changes to the properties will look like in
the main display.
Properties Dialog - Display Tab

Image 2: Properties Dialog - Display
This tab allows you to assign which observation variable is associated with that item. Numerical values should appear in a "Value" item, text in a
"Text" item, etc. You can also set units and the display format.
Parameter identifiers within a station model can hold embedded Jython code. This allows you to do operations on the values and provide more
extensive formatting. Any parameter that begins with "=" is treated as a Jython expression. For example, you can enter:
=T-TD
to calculate the dewpoint depression. You can format the text that is shown. For example you can enter:
='TD:'+str(T-TD)
This will result in the calculation of T-TD, a conversion of that result to a string which is then concatenated to the string 'TD:'. If you want to
format the result of the numeric calculation using the format specifier from the properties dialog simply enter:
='TD:'+format(T-TD)
Properties Dialog - Color By Tab

Image 3: Properties Dialog - Color By
This tab allows you to specify a parameter that is used to color the shape. You can specify a data range (and a corresponding unit for the data
range, e.g., celsius). This data range is used as the end point ranges for the specified color table.
For example, in the above image the Temperature parameter has been specified with data range -90-45 celsius. For each display McIDAS-V will
find the Temperature value (e.g., 15 celsius), convert it, if necessary to the specified unit, find its where is lays within the range and use the
corresponding color from the color table.

Image 4: Properties Dialog - Color From
This allows you to specify parameter, a set of (regular expression) patterns and a corresponding color. If the text value of the parameter matches
one of the patterns then the given color is used to color the shape. For example, if your point data had a "fruit" field in it (e.g., fruit=banana,
apple, tangerine) you could define different colors for different values of fruit.
To get more lines press the Apply button.
Properties Dialog - Scale Size Tab

Image 5: Properties Dialog - Scale Size By
This allows you to specify a parameter to scale the shape by. It works similarly to the Color By facility described above. You specify a parameter,
a data range (with a unit if desired), and a scale factor range. For each point display McIDAS-V will find the value of the parameter, determine
where that value lies within the data range and find the corresponding scaling from the scale factor range.
Properties Dialog - Rotate Tab

Image 6: Properties Dialog - Rotate By
This works like the scale and color by facilities. Specify a parameter, data range and rotation range. Note, the rotation is about the Z axis in X/Y/Z
space. It is not a rotation in Lat/Lon space.

Display Settings
The Display Settings facility allows you to select a set of properties from a display control (e.g., color table, contouring info, isosurface value,
label template, etc.) and apply them to other display controls and/or save them as preferences to be used when creating new display controls.
The Display Settings dialog, pictured below, can be brought up from a layer control's Edit->Display Settings... menu.

Image 1: Display Settings Dialog
On the left is a list of all of the source display controls in McIDAS-V. In the middle are the properties of the currently selected display control
which is shown highlighted in blue on the left. On the right is also a list of the display controls. These are the target display controls.
The idea is that you can select properties in the middle panel that you want to apply to the selected target display controls (via the checkboxes) on
the right. Many of the properties can be changed by clicking on the
buttons.
The View menu is a handy way of selecting different groups of target display controls. For example, you can select All Displays, displays of
certain types, displays that have the same data sources, etc.

Display Settings Examples
For example, say you have two different data sources loaded with 3 or 4 displays created from each. Normally, the legend will list all of the
displays based on some display category (e.g., Plan Views). However, you want to be able to change their display category so that each group of
displays that are from one data source have the same category (e.g., "Data source 1", "Data source 2"). What you would do in this case is change
the "Display Category" property under "Labels" to "Data Source 1".

Then, you could manually select the displays you want to change but an easier way is to use the Display Groups menu and choose "Displays
with data source ...":

This selects the displays with the data source of the currently selected display (the one highlighted in blue).
Once selected you then hit Apply. This will set the "Display Category" property on the selected display controls.
To do the next set of displays select a new Source display control in the list on the left. This will select this display and reset the properties list in
the middle. Then when you do the Display Groups->Displays with data source the displays that share the data source from this new display will
be selected.

Saving Display Settings
You can save the set of selected settings with the Save button. The Save Settings dialog will be shown:

Image 2: Save Settings Dialog
You can enter a category and a name. The saved settings will be shown under the Saved Settings menu. When selected they will be applied to the
list of properties on the left. The Applicable only to displays of type button, will be used when showing the saved settings in the Field Selector
(described below).

Using Display Settings in the Field Selector
The set of saved display settings are also shown in the field selector:

Image 3: Display Settings in Field Selector
You can select any number of these and, when a new display control is created, these settings will be applied to the new display. The Show All
check box allows you to list all of the settings, regardless if they were saved off for a particular type of display.

Parameter Alias Editor
The Parameter Alias Editor is opened through the Tools menu with Tools->Parameters->Aliases menu and allows for the association between
"canonical" parameter names used by McIDAS-V for physical quantities, such as TEMP for temperature, and parameter names used in particular
data sets for the same quantity, such as for example "jan_mean_temp."

Different data sets often have different names for the same physical quantity, such as for the quantities temperature or easterly wind speed
component. You can make McIDAS-V recognize any particular data name as representing a standard quantity. The Alias Editor associates any
particular variable name that may appear in a data set (right column) with a canonical or McIDAS-V name or alias (left column).
The Alias Editor has a number of tabs that display the user editable aliases and the non-editable system aliases. You can right-click on a row in
the system alias tab to copy that row to the user's tab. You can also add a new alias with the New Alias button. You can edit a user's entry by
right-clicking on the table row.
When you do this the alias properties dialog is shown where you can edit the name, label (descriptive text) and the aliases:

Parameter Defaults Editor
The Parameter Defaults Editor is opened through the Tools menu with Tools->Parameters->Defaults and allows for the specification of default
color tables, ranges, units, and contouring values for different parameters.

Image 1: Parameter Defaults Editor
This feature lets you preset conventional color and contouring choices, and lets you override system defaults.
There are two sets of defaults: user defaults in the tab User defaults , and system defaults supplied with McIDAS-V in the System defaults tab.
Look at the system defaults for examples. These are general common parameter names, such as u for the eastward wind component, and special
names we have encountered that our users may also use, such as p_msl for mean sea level pressure.
The system settings cannot be edited by the user, but right clicking a row allows you to copy a parameter to the "user defined" table. When you do
this the Parameter Defaults Properties window allows you to define what properties you want to define:

Image 2: Parameter Defaults Properties
Simply check or uncheck the Defined buttons and define the settings as desired. From the user defined table you can also right click on a row to
add a new row, edit the settings for the row or delete the row.
The parameter names are given in regular expression syntax to help match with actual data names. Plain text is matched exactly. The string dot
star, ".*", means "any text here." The ^ means "begin with the following text exactly."

Parameter Groups Editor
The Parameter Groups Editor is opened through the Tools menu with Tools->Parameters->Groups and allows for the specification of
"parameter groups", named groups of parameter names.

Image 1: Parameter Groups Editor
There are two sets of defaults: user defaults in the tab User Groups, and system groups supplied with McIDAS-V in the System Groups tab.
Look at the system defaults for examples.
The system settings cannot be edited by the user, but right clicking a row allows you to copy a group to the "user defined" table. When you do
this the Parameter Groups Properties window allows you to define the sets of parameters that fall under this group.

Image 2: Parameter Groups Properties

Contour Properties Editor
The Contour Properties Editor is invoked from any contour display control with the Contour: Change button or through Edit->Change
Contours... .

Use the items in this window to set contouring properties.
Contour Interval determines the spacing (difference in value) between contours.Set it to a single value to specify a regular interval between
contours. You can specify irregular contour intervals with a semi-colon separated list of the values. For example:
5400;5460;5800
would only show the 5400, 5460 and 5800 contour lines.
You can also specify different contour intervals for different ranges with the following syntax:
cint1/min1/max1;cint2/min1/max2;....;cintn/minn/maxn
For example, for geopotential heights:
30/0/4200;60/4200/8600;120/8600/24000
would draw contours at 30 gpm between 0 and 4200, 60 gpm between 4200 and 8600 and 120 gpm between 8600 and 24000.
To show a single contour line, specify the contour interval, min and max as the same value. For example:
5400/5400/5400
would only show the 5400 line.
Base contour is the value on which all contours are based. All contours will be integer multiples of the contour interval from the base value. For
example, with a base value of 0 and a contour interval of 3 contours would be created at ..-6, -3, 0, 3, 6... A base of 1 with that interval would
create contours at ..-5, -2, 1, 4, 7... The base value need not be the lowest contour level on a plot, or inside the range of values plotted; it is only a
computational reference point. The base contour value is also used for controlling which lines are dashed.
Minimum value is a limit below which no contour lines are shown. The minimum may be larger than the base value, so that the base value may
never appear on a plot.
Maximum value is an upper limit above which no contour lines are shown. The minimum and maximum values need not match contour line
values; they are only limits.
Line width sets the line width (in pixels) of the contour lines and labels.
You can toggle the labels by clicking the Labels check box.
If Dash is checked, values less than the base value are dashed. If base is set higher than maximum value, then all lines are dashed. Use the
pulldown menu to select the dash pattern to use.
Click on OK to set the values you want and close this window. Click Apply to set the values but leave this window open.

Image and Movie Capture
You can capture the main 3D view as an image, a QuickTime movie or an animated GIF.
Saving Images
Print Current View
Save QuickTime Movies
Play QuickTime Movies

Saving Images
You can save a display as an image. Select the View->Capture->Image... menu item. A file dialog will popup where you can enter a file name
for the image file. McIDAS-V supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, PDF, PS, and SVG formats. From this File Dialog you can also specify the image
quality (only used for JPEGs) and what to capture. You can also select whether or not the background is transparent.
Note: when capturing a image the screen cannot be obscured.
McIDAS-V can also write out an image and the corresponding Google Earth KML or KMZ file. For this to be correct the projection must be a
Lat/Lon geographic projection (i.e., rectilinear) and in an overhead view. Some of the default projections that are Lat/Lon include World, Africa,
Asia, Australia, and the individual state projections (US->States->...). You can also create your own Lat/Lon projection using the Projection
Manager. The simplest way to get a correct projection is to select the Projections->Set Current View as Projection menu item. If you specify a
.kml file McIDAS-V will generate an image with the same file prefix and the kml file that refers to the image. If you specify a .kmz file (which is
a zip format) it will contain the image and the kml file.

Print Current View
You can send any display to a printer. Select the View->Capture->Print... menu item. A Print dialog will popup where you can configure and
print an image.

Save Movies
You can save any sequence of displays as a movie. Select the View->Capture->Movie... menu item to bring up the "Movie capture" window:

To make a movie there are three steps: capturing the frames, previewing the frames, and creating the movie. McIDAS-V supports QuickTime
movie, animated GIF, AVI file, Google Earth KMZ and ANIS Applet HTML file formats.
To capture frames, in the Capture section of the "Image capture" window, do one of the following three choices:
click on the Capture one image button to make a single frame of the current McIDAS-V display. Then you change the display to exactly
what you want in the next frame, capture that new image, and continue through the movie.
Click on Capture animation to automatically capture all frames in a display time sequence which you can animate with the usual
McIDAS-V Time Animation Controls . Check Reset to start time to ensure that you capture the entire animation sequence. The QuickTime
animation capture starts on the first frame visible in McIDAS-V and goes to the end. So you can use this to capture part of a sequence.
Click on Capture automatically to start taking snapshots of frames from the McIDAS-V display while you make changes, such as while
you change the viewpoint by zooming, rotation, and panning, and combinations of all three. To stop the automatic snapshots, click on the
button again (which now says Stop). You can set the automatic snapshot sampling rate with the Rate field.
You can combine these different methods of capture. The list of frames is additive.
If you want to save the individual intermediate files that are used to create the movie, check the Save files to box and specify a directory and file
name format. Otherwise, the intermediate files will be saved in a temporary directory and will be removed.
You can use the following templates to customize the name of the output file:
%count% is the image counter
%count:decimal format% allows you to format the count using the same rules defined in the lat/lon format section of the User
Preferences. (or Google 'java decimalformat' for more information).
%time% is the animation time in the default format
%time:time format% a template that begins with "time:" and contains a time format string using the the same date formatting rules

described in the User Preferences.
You can Preview the movie and remove individual frames or Delete All the frames.
When done capturing frames select the Save movie button to specify the name and format of the file you want to save.

Play QuickTime Movies
McIDAS-V supports displaying certain types of Quicktime movies (including the ones McIDAS-V generates). Load in the Quicktime movie from
the File Data Chooser.

Timeline
McIDAS-V makes use of a timeline widget in a variety of areas. The timeline allows you to see the temporal distribution of a set of times and
easily select them. There can also be a date selection mechanism (see below) that allows you to select based on a range, interval, etc.

Image 1: Chooser Timeline

Date Selection
The date selection is defined by:
Start/End date: These define the range to look within.
Interval : If defined, this allows you to select dates every N time units. For example, you can set the interval to be one hour. The times that
are selected are the ones closest to the one hour interval ticks.
Before/After Range: These are displayed by the little gray triangles in the timeline. By default, the ranges that we use are one half the size
of the interval. However, you can set the range both before and after the interval tick. So for example, if you want to just consider times
within 15 minutes before the interval but nothing after the interval set the Before Range to be 15 minutes and the After Range to be 0
minutes.
Count: You can specify a max number of times that will be selected. Only the most recent N times will be selected.
Skip Factor : This says to skip every N'th time that would be selected. For example, the date selection first considers the interval/ranges (if
defined), then it applies the skip (e.g., only every 3rd time), then it looks at the max count.
These can be accessed by right-clicking in the timeline to show a popup menu. The menu allows you explicitly define these settings through a
Properties dialog or (much more easy) set them directly with sub-menu choices.

The View Managers use the timeline to show the animation time set and the times of the different displays. Here, the timeline is used for
informational purposes and is not used to select times. This can be shown through the View->Animation Timeline menu. The gray timeline
represents non-visible displays. Double clicking in a timeline sets the animation step to that time.

Image 2: Animation Times

Timeline Navigation
The timeline supports a variety of navigation mechanisms:
Event
Left Mouse Drag
Left/Right Arrow

Up/Down Arrow

Mouse Click; ControlClick; Shift-Click
Shift-Drag
Right Mouse Click

Action
Change visible range or date selection range.
Change visible range.
Use Control-Key to change date selection.
Use Shift-Key to use larger increment.
Zoom in/out visible range.
Use Control-Key to change date selection.
Use Shift-Key to use larger increment.
Select individual times, multiple times or a range of times
When not showing the date selection mechanism you can choose a range of times with shift-drag
This brings up a popup menu that allows you to show the properties dialog, go to particular current date ranges, set the
interval, range, skip factor and count of the date selection.

Message Console
Clicking on the main menu bar choice Help->Show console shows a console window which has error messages and other text output from
McIDAS-V. Error messages created before you open the console are shown, as well as later ones.

The console is useful if you encounter an error as you can save the console message to a file and include it in email to McIDAS-V Support at
SSEC or attach it in the Support Request Form.

Support Request Form
Clicking on the main menu bar choice Help->Support Request Form... shows a form to post a support request to the McIDAS Help Desk. This
form can also be brought up from the Error Dialog.

Image 1: Support Request Form
If you encounter a problem or have a comment to share, you can use this form to do so. You can also add attachments to your submission.
When the Include Current State as Bundle button is checked, the current state of McIDAS-V will be submitted along with your request.
When the Send Copy of Support Request to Me is checked, a copy of the email will be sent to the email address you provided in the request.

Bundles
Bundles let you save a quick "snapshot" of McIDAS-V, including data sources, maps, and data displays. Bundles are small information files that
specify the state of McIDAS-V. They are a kind of configuration file. They include information about what data sources are in use, and which
parameters from the data sources are displayed, and how they are displayed.
The purpose of bundles is for you to save a particular McIDAS-V setup and display. A bundle can be used for your own reference at a later time,
or others using McIDAS-V can use bundles you made to see data the same way you did.

Saving a Bundle
To make a new bundle file, select the File->Save Bundle menu. A pop-up window will let you set a new file location and name:

Image 1: Save Bundle Dialog
The customary McIDAS-V bundle filename extension is .mcv ; if you do not enter a file extension, .mcv will be appended. When saving a .mcv
file, no data is saved with the bundle, only references to the remote or local Data Sources are saved.
McIDAS-V does support a zipped data bundle format: .mcvz. This is a zip file that contains a regular bundle (.mcv) and a set of data files. When
the user does a "Save Bundle" or "Save Favorite " and specifies a .mcvz file extension, McIDAS-V prompts the user to select the data sources that
should be written into the zip file. When opening a .mcvz file, McIDAS-V needs to unzip the data files, so it prompts the user as to where to
place the files - a temporary directory or a user selected directory (this is a preference as well).
Note: In order for bundle files to work, the data must be available in exactly the same way you made connection to it when you made
the bundle file. Others who use your bundles must have access to the same file system or to the same remote or local data servers you
use, so that file paths or URLs to the data are exactly the same.
The file dialog has a set of buttons to define how parts of your bundle is saved.
The Jython menu allows you to save the Jython code you may have in your library in different ways. For example, you may have written
some custom Jython code that implements a Formula. You have a display that uses the results of that computation. To include your local
Jython code just select All Jython or Selected Jython . When loading in a bundle that has had Jython code saved with it, the user will be
prompted for what to do with the Jython.
One can save a bundle with data paths that are relative to where the bundle is loaded from by checking the Save with relative paths
checkbox. McIDAS-V will change the file based data sources to point to the directory where the bundle is loaded from. For example, you
can use this to save a bundle that references model files on disk. Copy the bundle and the model files over to a thumb drive or CD. Then
when you load the bundle the files are relative to the bundle path.

Saving a Bundle as a Favorite
Favorite bundles are just normal bundles that are categorized and saved off in a particular location on disk and serve as a convenience to the user.
This allows the user to organize their favorites by category and readily load them in. Favorite bundles are easily available through the Bundles
menu and can also be displayed on the toolbar of the Main Display window.
A favorite bundle can be created through the File->Save Favorite ... menu:

Image 2: Save As Favorite Dialog
Define your favorite bundle by specifying a category in the Category field and a name in the Name field. Categories can be hierarchical; by
using a ">" as a separator (e.g. Toolbar>sounding ) the categories will appear as a tree structure in the Local Favorites Bundles Manager. The

"Toolbar" category is a special category in the Favorite Bundles Manager. The bundles in the Toolbar category will also appear as links in the
toolbar of your Main Display window.
The Local Favorite Bundles Manager, accessed through the Bundles->Manage... menu, allows you to reorganize the categories and favorites by
drag-and-drop, or right click on a favorite or a category to delete it, export it, etc.:

Image 3: Favorites Manager

Opening a Bundle
Use the File->Open File menu to open a bundle. When loading in a new bundle you will be prompted whether the current displays and data
should be removed. You can also start up McIDAS-V with a bundle file or URL in the command line.

Copying Data Locally
For most remote data types, data can be copied from the server to the local disk using the "Make Remote Data Local" facility. The following
ADDE types are supported: satellite, radar, point, sounding and forecast fronts. There is also preliminary support for grids on remote servers * (see
below).
This is used in two ways. First, the user can right click on a data source in the Field Selector and select "Make Data Local" for remote data
sources. McIDAS-V prompts for a file directory and a file prefix (the default is to use the name of the data source) and the remote data is copied
over. For multiple files the format used is: <directory><prefix><file count>.<suffix>. The data source object within McIDAS-V is then changed
to point to the new file paths.
The second way this is used is when a .mcvz file is saved. The user is prompted for both the local data sources to be saved off as well as for the
remote data sources. For the remote ones, McIDAS-V automatically copies the files over and zips them.
* Grids:

There is preliminary support for grids. This support relies on some extra service information in the catalogs which, right at this moment,
is not included in the regular IDV gridded data catalog but is included for model data under the "File_Access" dataset in the main motherlode
catalog: http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.xml When saving gridded data the user is prompted for the fields to save and the geospatial subset is used to subset the grids. As of right now, there is not yet support for sub-setting on times and grid stride/decimation.

IDV Bundles
McIDAS-V has the ability to load and save IDV bundles (.xidv and .zidv), but all of the features between the two software packages may not be
compatible, and therefore the bundles may not load properly in the other software package.

McIDAS-V Scripting
McIDAS-V can be scripted to create and manipulate images and movies. The scripting is accomplished using Jython or through an XML file:
IDV Scripting Language (ISL). The ISL file can be opened from a running McIDAS-V or one can be passed to McIDAS-V as a command line
argument:
runMcV capture.isl
A Jython script can be invoked as a command line argument:
runMcV -islfile capture.py
You can also run McIDAS-V in interactive mode using an ISL script to set up the state of McIDAS-V (e.g., loading data, displays, etc.) with the islinteractive argument:
runMcV capture.isl -islinteractive
McIDAS-V can run in "offscreen" mode (see more) with an ISL or with Jython. The user interface won't be shown. However, McIDAS-V still
needs to be run with an active window system (e.g., X, MS Windows) for it to run. If running under a Linux/Unix machine and you don't have an
X server running you need to run McIDAS-V under the X virtual frame buffer: xvfb.
If running under a Windows machine, it is necessary to use "\\" instead of "\" in scripts when specifying directory paths to avoid Windows
interpreting it as an escape sequence.
The usual mode of use of the ISL is to load in an McIDAS-V bundle which defines the data and displays that you want captured. In Jython, this is
a call to the loadBundle() method. As a convenience, when you go to save a bundle (e.g., using the File->Save As menu), you can specify a .isl
file suffix. When you do this McIDAS-V will write out both the bundle file and an example ISL file. It will first prompt you for some basic ISL
information:

Image 1: Save As ISL Dialog
You can, for example, include the text of the bundle file directly within the ISL file (so you only have one file to deal with). You can also specify
how many iterations of the loop to do and whether to create an image and/or a movie. When using Jython, you would simply use the feature of
the Jython language to accomplish list.

ISL Overview
A note: in this documentation required attributes are shown in bold .

ISL and XML
Before we start a couple of comments about writing the ISL. ISL files are written in XML and they need to be syntactically correct. A couple of
reminders:
XML is fully nested. There is only one root tag and all other tags are descendants of the root.
All tags have to be closed. Either do:
<sometag/>
or
<sometag> <i>contained tags</i> </sometag>
If you want to include special characters like '<', '>' and '"' you need to escape them with: '&lt;', '&gt;', '&quot;'.
You can comment out sections of XML with '<!--' ... '-->'. e.g:
... <!-- <sometag/> -->
The ISL file starts with a isl tag:
<isl debug="true"> ... ISL tags ... </isl>
If there is a debug="true" in the isl tag then McIDAS-V will print out processing messages.
Here is a simple isl file:
<isl> <image file="test.png"/> </isl>

capture1.isl

You can run this by going:
runMcV capture1.isl
or through the File->Open menu from a running McIDAS-V.
Notice when you run this from the command line that no image is created. That is because there are no view windows. We can load in a bundle
before we capture the image. Note, if you run this isl file you should have a test.xidv bundle file around.
<isl> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <image file="test.png"/> </isl>
capture2.isl
A caveat: Right now McIDAS-V does not gracefully handle when you have a bundle that has more than one view window.
The pause tag has McIDAS-V wait until all displays have been created. The bundle tag loads in the specified bundle. Note, this file is relative to
the directory where McIDAS-V is running. You can provide an absolute path or even a URL as a file:
<bundle file="/some/path/test.xidv"/> <bundle
file="http://www.somesite.edu/test.xidv"/>
The file for the output image is also relative to where McIDAS-V is running. The type of image that is created is determined by the file suffix.
McIDAS-V can generate gif, jpg and png. You can have multiple image tags:
<isl> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <image file="test.png"/> <image
file="test.gif"/> <image file="test.jpg"/> </isl>
multi.isl
The isl tag can have a loop and a sleep argument. The sleep argument is the number of seconds to sleep after each iteration of the loop.
<isl loop="100" sleep="600"> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <image
file="test.png"/> </isl>
loop.isl
This will loop through the set of commands 100 times. After each iteration of the loop McIDAS-V will sleep for 10 minutes (600 seconds).
Note: the above loop example will keep writing out to the same image file. We can use the macro expansion facility, described here: property , to
change the file name every loop iteration:
<isl loop="100" sleep="600"> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <image
file="test${loopindex}.png"/> </isl>
loop2.isl
This will write out the images test0.png, test1.png, test2.png, etc.
One can use group tags to hold a set of children tags. There can be any level of nesting. The group tag can also hold a loop and sleep attribute
<isl loop="100" sleep="600"> <group loop="2" sleep="60"> <image file="test.png"/>
</group> </isl>
nested.isl

Basic ISL Tags
< isl > Top level ISL tag
<isl
debug="'true' or 'false'"
offscreen="'true' or 'false'"
loop="integer loop count"
sleep="seconds to sleep" >
The isl tag is the top level tag. It acts just like the group tag but it can also hold a debug attribute which results in status messages being printed
out. The offscreen attribute allows you to turn off offscreen rendering (the default is to do offscreen rendering).
< group > Group a set of tags. Possibly loop.
<group
loop="integer loop count"
sleep="seconds to sleep after each loop iteration" >
The group tag holds an arbitrary number of children tags.
< property > Define a property
<property
name ="property name"
value="property value"
fromfile="filename to read contents from"
global="true/false" >
You can define properties with the property tag. Any subsequent tag may have these property values substituted by using:
${propertyname}
e.g.:
<property name="basedir" value="/some/directory"/> <property name="fromfile"
fromfile="${islpath}/template.txt"/> <property name="imagetype" value="png"/> <image
file="${basedir}/theimage.${imagetype}"/>
The state within an ISL is stack based - i.e., if you are in a group tag or calling a procedure (see below) the properties defined there are local to
that group or procedure call. When you leave that group or procedure call, any properties that are defined are removed. However, you can specify
global="true" in the property tag; this will cause the property to be defined globally.
There is a set of predefined properties that can be used. As described above, if you are in a loop the property ${loopindex} will be set to the loop
index. e.g.:
<isl loop="1000" sleep="3600"> <bundle file="test${loopindex}.xidv"/> </isl>
The set of date and time values for the current time is also available. The property names are those defined for the Java SimpleDateFormat class.
If you preface any of these properties with "anim:" then the current animation time (if defined) is used. e.g.:
${anim:yyyy}
The time properties are:
${yyyy}
Year
${yy}
Last 2 yar digits
${M}
month number
${MM}
two character month number
${MMM}
Short month name
${MMMMM} Full month name
${D}
Day in year
${d}
Day in month
${dd}
two character day in month
${EEE}
Day name
${H}
0 based hour in day (24 hour)
${HH}
0 based two character hour in day (24 hour)
${k}
1 based hour in day (24 hour)
${kk}
1 based two character hour in day (24 hour)
${K}
Hour in am/pm (12 hour)
${KK}
two character hour in am/pm
${a}
am/pm
${mm}
two character minute in hour
${s}
second in minute
${ss}
two character second in minute
${S}
Millisecond
${Z}
Timezone
${G}
Era designator
You can also define a property with "now:<some date format>" in it. This takes the current time and formats it with the full date format. e.g.,:
${now:yyyy-MM-DD} ${now:yyyy_MM_DD:hh:mm}

You can also use "time:" to use the current animation time as the time to format:
${time:yyyy-MM-DD} ${time:yyyy_MM_DD:hh:mm}
< append> Append to a property
<append
name ="property name"
value="property value"
fromfile="filename to read contents from" >
This is just like the property tag but it appends the value.
< idvproperty> Define one of the McIDAS-V properties
<idvproperty
name ="property name"
value="property value"
fromfile="filename to read contents from"
global="true/false" >
This allows you to set properties in McIDAS-V that may affect image capture behavior, etc. For example, doing:
<idvproperty name="idv.capture.sleep" value="1000"/>
sets the pause between each movie frame capture to be 1000 milliseconds.
< echo > Print a message
<echo
message="text to print out" >
The echo tag allows you to print out a message. Here, for example, we are printing out the loop index and the date/time:
<isl loop="10" sleep="1"> <echo message="Loop iteration: ${loopindex} at: ${yyyy}${MM}-${dd} ${HH}:${mm}:${ss}"/> <echo> The message can also be contained by the echo
tag </echo> </isl>
echo.isl
< import> Import another isl file
<import
file ="isl file" >
The import tag allows you to import another ISL file. For example, using the import tag here:
<isl> <import file="systemdefs.isl"/> </isl>

import.isl

Where systemdefs.isl has:
<isl> <property name="prop1" value="somevalue"/> <property name="prop2"
value="somevalue"/> </isl>
systemdefs.isl
Will result in something like:
<isl> ... <group> <property name="prop1" value="somevalue"/> <property name="prop2"
value="somevalue"/> </group> ... </isl>
You could use the import, for example, as a way of having common property definitions (e.g., location of data, images, etc.) shared by a set of
ISL files.
< procedure> Define an isl procedure
<procedure
name ="procedure name" >
The procedure tag allows you to define a "procedure" that can be called with the call tag.
< call> Call an isl procedure
<call
name ="procedure name to call" >
The call tag allows you to call a procedure. The attributes within the call tag are set as properties and can be referenced within the procedure tags.
For example, here we have a procedure called "makeImage" It is called two times, passing in values for bundlefile and imagefile. As noted, you
can also drop the call tag and use the procedure name as the tag name.
<isl> <procedure name="makeImage"> <bundle file="${bundlefile}"/> <pause/> <image
file="${imagefile}"> <thumbnail width="25%"/> </image> </procedure> <call
name="makeImage" bundlefile="test1.xidv" imagefile="test1.png"/> <call name="makeImage"
bundlefile="test2.xidv" imagefile="test2.png"/> <!-- Note: you can also call the
procedure directly with: --> <makeImage bundlefile="test2.xidv" imagefile="test2.png"/>
</isl>
procedure.isl
< jython> Evaluate some Jython
<jython
code="inline jython code to evaluate"
file="jython file to evaluate" >

The jython tag allows you to evaluate jython. The Jython is specified both in line as well as file based:
<isl> <jython file="somejython.py"/> <!-- Or: --> <jython code="some jython code"/> <!- Or: --> <jython> <![CDATA[ some jython code ]]> </jython> </isl>
jython.isl
This Jython is evaluated by an interpreter that has all of the normal McIDAS-V Jython libraries. The global variable "idv" points to the
IntegratedDataView. The global variable "ig" points to the instance of the ImageGenerator class that is running the ISL.
All attribute values can also be prefixed with "jython:". This allows you to write a snippet of jython code that will return an attribute value:
<isl loop="10"> <echo message="jython:'number = ' + str(${loopindex}*50)"/> </isl>
jythoninattr.isl
< stop> Stop all processing
The stop tag allows you to stop processing the ISL file and exit:
<stop/>
< pause > Pause for some time
<pause
seconds="number of seconds to pause"
minutes="number of minutes to pause"
hours="number of hours to pause"
every="number of hours past midnight" >
The pause tag can have a number of attributes:
<pause/>
No arguments will pause until all displays have been created.
<pause seconds="10"/>
<pause minutes="5.5"/>
<pause hours="12.5"/>
<pause every="1"/>
<pause every=".5"/>
<pause every="0.25"/>

Pause for 10 seconds.
Pause for 5.5 minutes.
Pause for 12.5 hours.
Pause until the next hour. The 'every' attribute means every N hours after midnight.
Pause until the next hour or half hour.
Pause until the next 15 minute time. e.g., on the hour, quarter after, half past, etc.

< foreach> For each loop
<foreach
value1="comma separated values"
...="..."
valuen="comma separated values" >
The foreach tag allows you to iterate across a set of comma separated values.
<foreach fruit="apple,orange,banana" color="red,green,blue" ... valueN="..."> ... Any
ISL tags. The property references ${fruit}, ${color}, etc., will be replaced the values
above. e.g., First time in the loop ${fruit} will be replaced with 'apple', ${color}
with 'red', etc. ... </foreach>
For example, here we are generating three different image types:
<isl> <foreach suffix="png,jpg,gif"> <echo message="Creating test.${suffix}"/> <image
file="test.${suffix}"/> </foreach> </isl>
foreach.isl
< exec > Execute a shell command
<exec
command="some shell command to exec" >
The exec tag allows you to execute external programs. For example, if you were generating images on one machine and then need to scp them to
your web server you could do:
<isl> <property name="imagefile" value="test.png"/> <group loop="1000" sleep="3600">
<bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <image file="test.png"/> <exec command="scp
${imagefile} yourwebserver:/imagedir/${imagefile}"/> </group </isl>
exec.isl
< if> An if statement
<if
expr="jython expression to evaluate" >
The if tag allows you to have decision structures in your ISL. The form is:
<if expr="some jython expression"> <then> ... The then block ... </then> <else> ... The
optional else block ... </else> </if>
For example, say you only wanted to generate a particular image when the hour of the day is after 12 noon. You could do:

<isl loop="1000" sleep="3600"> <!-- Note the less than sign is escaped --> <if
expr="${k}>12"> <then> <echo message="Generating image at ${k}:${mm}"/> <image
file="test.png"/> </then> </if> <!-- Or you can include the expression in a CDATA
block: so you don't have to escape anything --> <if> <![CDATA[${k}>12]]> <then> <echo
message="Generating image at ${k}:${mm}"/> <image file="test.png"/> </then> </if>
</isl>
if.isl

File ISL Tags
The ISL supports a variety of file manipulation functions.
< fileset > Specify a set of files for use with other tags
<fileset
dir="directory to look at"
pattern="regular expression pattern to match files"
file="the single file to select" >
The fileset tag does not execute anything. Rather, it is used by other tags to specify a group of files.
<fileset dir="the directory to look at" pattern="file pattern to match"/> Or: <fileset
file="somefile"/>
< mkdir > Make a directory
<mkdir
file ="The directory to create" >
The mkdir tag creates a directory specified by the file attribute:
<mkdir file="somedirectory"/>
There is no error if the directory already exists.
< rename> Rename a file
<rename
from="The file to rename"
to ="The new file name" >
The rename tag allows you to rename a file:
<rename from "somefile" to="newfile"/>
< delete > Delete a file
The delete tag deletes a set of files:
<delete> <fileset dir="/some/directory" pattern="*.png"/> <fileset name="somefile"/>
</delete>
< move> Move a file
The move tag moves a set of files to a destination directory.
<move dir="destination directory"> <fileset dir="/some/directory" pattern="*.png"/>
<fileset name="somefile"/> </move>
< copy > Copy a file
The copy tag copies a set of files to a destination directory.
<copy dir="destination directory"> <fileset dir="/some/directory" pattern="*.png"/>
<fileset name="somefile"/> </copy>

ISL Data and Displays
< bundle > Load a bundle
<bundle
file ="bundle file or url"
width="view window width"
height="view window height"
times="List of times to use"
clear="default is true. remove all existing displays and data"
wait="default is true. wait until all displays have been rendered." >
The bundle tag lets you load in a new bundle and takes the form:
<bundle file="some_bundle_file.xidv"/>
By default it will remove all currently loaded data and displays. If you don't want to clear out the data and displays then add a clear="false"
attribute:
<bundle file="some_bundle_file.xidv" clear="false"/>
The wait attribute, if true (the default), will essentially do a pause, waiting until all displays have been rendered.
The times attribute allows you to override the set of time indices that are used in the data sources in the bundle. Note: this overrides the times for
all data sources in the bundle.
The value is a comma separated list of time specifiers where the specifier can be a single time, a time range or a time range with a step. The time
indices are 0 based, e.g., the first time index is 0. The time range is of the form "firsttime:lasttime". To specify a step do: "firsttime:lasttime:step"
For example, we have:
times="0" -- Just use the first time times="2" -- Just use the third time times="0,1,2" -- Just
use the first 3 times times="0:10" -- 0 through 10 times="0:10:2" -- 0,2,4,6,8,10
times="0:10:2, 20:30" -- 0,2,4,6,8,10 20-30 times="1,2,3,5:11:2,20,30" -- 1,2 3, 5,7,9,11, 20,
30
< setfiles > Override the files or urls used in a bundle
<setfiles
datasource="identifier of the data source"
file="new file or url path" >
The bundle tag can contain any number of "setfiles" tags. Each of these setfiles tags has a datasource attribute which is used to find the data
source in the bundle by name. There is also a file attribute which defines a file to use for that data source.
e.g.:
<isl debug="true" offscreen="false"> <bundle file="test.xidv"> <setfiles
datasource=".*" file="/upc/share/testdata/grid/netcdf/nuwg/ruc.nc"/> </bundle> <image
file="test.png"/> </isl>
The bundle above only has one data source. The:
datasource=".*"
identifies the data source by name. In this case it is a regular expression that matches anything. If you had multiple data sources you can change
their name before you save the bundle (right click on the data source in the field selector and got to the Properties dialog.) You can then use these
names to match. e.g.:
<isl debug="true" offscreen="false"> <bundle file="test.xidv"> <setfiles
datasource="datasource1" file="file for first data source"/> <setfiles
datasource="datasource2" file="file for 2nd data source"/> </bundle> <image
file="test.png"/> </isl>
If you have a data source with multiple files (e.g., radar) you can use an embedded fileset tag:
<setfiles datasource="datasource1"> <fileset file="some file"/> <fileset file="some
other file"/> ... </setfiles>
< datasource> Create a data source
<datasource
url ="url or file name to load"
type="data source type" >
The datasource tag lets you create a new data source. The url attribute is required and specifies the file or url to load. The type attribute is
optional and defines the data source type from the datasources.xml file in the source release. For a text listing see Datasources.html. For now you
can only specify a data source that takes a single url (or filename). This will change in the future.
<isl> <datasource url="dods://motherlode.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/dods/DODS-3.2.1/nphdods/dods/casestudies/idvtest/grids/small_ruc_grid.nc"> <!-- Set the name on the data
source --> <property name="name" value="the name"/> </datasource> </isl>
datasource.isl
< display > Create a display

<display
type ="display type"
param="parameter name" >
The display tag lets you create a display and can exist either on its own:
<display type="somedisplaytype" param="some_parameter"/>
or as a child tag of the datasource tag:
<isl> <!-- Create a datasource. Note: you can also have a template attribute that
points to a bundle xidv file that was saved from a data source:
bundle="${islpath}/datasource.xidv" --> <datasource
url="dods://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/casestudies/idvtest/grids/small_ruc_grid.nc"
id="datasource1"> <!-- Set the name on the data source --> <property name="name"
value="Example data source"/> <!-- Create a display of RH. Here we load in the display
from a template. --> <!-- <display param="RH" template="${islpath}/template.xidv">
<property name="id" value="display1"/> <property name="displayCategory" value="Category
1"/> <property name="legendLabelTemplate" value="%datasourcename% - %shortname%"/>
</display> --> <!-- Create a display of T. Here we create the display from the type -->
<display type="planviewcontour" param="T"> <property name="displayCategory"
value="Category 1"/> <!-- The contour info can be set with: interval;base;min;max
<property name="contourInfoParams" value="10;40;-30;100"/> Or it can have names in it:
--> <property name="contourInfoParams" value="interval=10;base=40;min=30;max=100;dashed=true;labels=false"/> <property name="legendLabelTemplate"
value="%datasourcename% - %shortname%"/> <!-- This sets the level to be 500
hectopascals --> <!-- Note: this can also be of the form #<index>, eg. #4 will select
the 5th level (this is zero based) --> <property name="dataSelectionLevel"
value="500[hectopascals]"/> </display> </datasource> <!-- Set the projection to the
data projection of the display we created above --> <!-- <center display="display1"
useprojection="true"/> --> </isl>
display.isl
The type attribute is one of the display control types defined in the controls.xml file from the source release and is required. For a text listing see
controls.txt .
The param attribute is not required. If specified, it is the name of a parameter in either the containing datasource tag or in one of the currently
loaded data sources. The display tag will evolve in time to provide a richer set of facilities for setting values on the display.
< removedisplays > Remove all displays
<removedisplays
display="display id to remove" >
This removes all current displays. If the display attribute is set, then it removes that display. ( See below ).
<removedisplays/>
< removeall> Remove all data and displays
Remove all current data and displays.
<removeall/>
< reload> Reload all loaded data
The reload tag tells all of the loaded data sources to reload, resulting in updated displays.
<reload/>
< center> Center a display at a lat/lon, or from a display control
<center
lat="latitude"
lon="longitude"
north="latitude"
south="latitude"
east="longitude"
west="longitude"
display="display id to center at"
useprojection="Use the projection from the display" >
The center tag comes in a number of forms, depending on the attributes:
<isl> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <echo message="Set the projection to be the
projection of the first display"/> <center/> <pause seconds="10"/> <echo
message="Center at a point"/> <center lat="15" lon="-65"/> <pause seconds="10"/> <echo
message="Set the projection to be the lat/lon box"/> <center north="40.0" south="30"
east="-90" west="-100"/> <pause seconds="10"/> <echo message="Set the projection from
the specified display"/> <center display="display1" useprojection="true"/> <pause
seconds="10"/> <echo message="Center at the center of the given displays projection"/>
<center display="display1" useprojection="false"/> <pause seconds="10"/> </isl>
center.isl
Using the display attribute specifies a display control to use. This can take two forms. First, you can specify a simple text pattern that we try to
match to the display's id. The id can be set from the display controls property dialog.

display="some name"
The second method is to specify a class name or partial class name:
display="class:ucar.unidata.idv.TrackControl" or: display="TrackControl"
< viewpoint > Change the viewpoint or aspect ratio of a view
<viewpoint
rotx="Rotation X"
roty="Rotation Y"
rotz="Rotation Z"
transx="Translation X"
transy="Translation Y"
transz="Translation Z"
scale="Scale"
aspectx="Aspect ratio x"
aspecty="Aspect ratio y"
aspectz="Aspect ratio z"
tilt="Tilt degrees"
azimuth="Asimuth degrees" >
The viewpoint tag comes in a number of forms, depending on the attributes:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <isl debug="true" loop="1"
offscreen="false" sleep="60.0minutes"> <bundle clear="true" file="${islpath}/test.xidv"
wait="true"/> <pause seconds="5"/> <!-- Specify a rotation, translation and scale.
These values are shown in the Aspect Ratio tab of the View Manager properties dialog -> <viewpoint rotx="75" roty="62" rotz="-3.3" scale="0.399" transx="0.0" transy="0.0"
transz="0.0"/> <pause seconds="5"/> <!-- You can also set the aspect ratio -->
<viewpoint aspectx="2" aspecty="5" aspectz="10"/> <pause seconds="5"/> <!-- You can
also specify a tilt and azimuth. This is the same as you can do interactively in the
viewpoint dialog --> <viewpoint tilt="45" azimuth="180"/> <pause seconds="5"/> </isl>
viewpoint.isl
The rot/trans/scale values can be viewed in the Aspect Ratio tab of the View Manager properties dialog.

ISL Images and Movies
The image and movie tag are the ones used to create images and movies. Both of these tags can contain subtags that allow you to manipulate the
image or images.
< image> Generate and manipulate images
<image
file ="image file, e.g., gif, png or jpg"
quality="image quality, 0.0-1.0"
view="view name or names to match"
display="display id"
what="what part of the display control should be captured" >
The image tag allows you to capture an image from a main display or from the GUI of a display control.
The file attribute defines the image file. For image formats that support it you can also specify a quality attribute that can range from close to
0.0(worst) to 1.0 (best and default).
The view attribute allows you to specify a name of a view it use. This can also be a regular expression pattern to use to match on multiple views.
If there are multiple views in existence and there is no view attribute specified or if there multiple views resulting from a view name attribute you
should use the viewindex and viewname in your filenames, etc., The viewindex property is the number of the view, e.g., the first view we capture
has viewindex of 0, the second viewindex = 1, etc.
The display attribute allows you to specify a display control to use to capture. For its use see here. The what attribute allows you to specify what
part of the display control gui should be captured. For now McIDAS-V only supports what="chart" to capture the time series chart of the station
model and data probe displays.
< movie > Create a Quicktime movie, animated GIF or Google Earth KMZ file
<movie
file="movie file"
view="view name or names to match"
imagedir="The directory to place the images."
imagetemplate="The file name template to use"
imagesuffix="Should be jpg if generating a QuickTime movie but can be gif or png as well">
The movie tag allows you to capture a time animation as a Quicktime movie or as an animated gif.
The view attribute is the same as in the image tag.
If the file ends with .mov then a Quicktime movie is created. If the file ends with .gif then an animated gif is created. If the file ends with .kmz
then a Google Earth KMZ file is created each being time stamped. Note: The file attribute can be a comma separated list of files, e.g.:
<movie file="test.mov,test.kmz,test.gif"/>
This allows you to capture multiple types of movie products in one call.
If no file attribute is specified then this just generates the images, not the movie. For example, you can not specify the file name but do specify the
imagedir and this will generate the images and place them in the imagedir for later processing.
The imagetemplate is a template filename that can contain text and three different macros, e.g.:
imagetemplate="image_%time%" Include the animation time formatted in the default format
imagetemplate="image_%count%" Include which image imagetemplate="image_%count%_%time:any date
format%" Include animation time in any date format. e.g.:
imagetemplate="image_%count%_%time:yyyyMMddHHmm%"
The generic date format can contain a specification that is used by the Java SimpleDateFormat and is described in Basic Tags .

KML Attributes
The movie tag also supports a set of KML specific attributes that allow you to configure the generated KML file.
<movie file="test.kmz" kml_desc="<a href="${wwwroot}/${bundle}">Run in the IDV</a>
(Needs Java Webstart)" kml_name="${label}" kml_visibility="0" kml_open="0">
kml_desc is the description for the KML Folder that holds the images. It can contain html.
kml_name is the folder name.
kml_visibility specifies whether the images are shown initially or not.
kml_open specifies whether the Folder is open or not.
Using your own images
You can also use any number of contained fileset tags to define a custom list of images that are used instead of the default images derived from
an animation capture.
<movie file="test.mov"> <fileset file="image1.png"/> <fileset file="image2.png"/>
<fileset file="image3.png"/> </movie>

Images Manipulation
There are a set of tags that can be contained by both the image and movie tags that support processing of the image. Most of these tags work on
the initial image and act as a filter pipeline. For example, the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90"/> <matte
bottom="150"/> </image>
Will generate an image from the main display. It will then clip the image at the given lat/lon bounding box and then add a matte with spacing of
150 pixels at the bottom of the image. It will then write out the image to the file test.png.

You can modify this behavior in a variety of ways. For example, the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90" copy="true"
file="clippedimage.gif"/> <matte bottom="150"/> </image>
will clip the original image but not alter it (the copy="true") and then will write out the clipped image to the given file. The original image will be
passed to the matte tag which will matte it.
The image manipulation tags can be nested. e.g. the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90" copy="true"
file="clippedimage.gif"> <matte bottom="150"/> <write file="somefile.jpg"/>
<transparent color="black"/> </clip> <matte bottom="150"/> </image>
Will clip a copy of the image, matte the copy, write out the matted image as somefile.jpg, set the color black to be transparent and then write it
out as clippedimage.gif. The original image is then matted and written out as test.png.
< panel > Create a gridded layout of a set of images. This is just like the movie tag and support all of the above attributes
<panel
file="output image file"
movieattributes="All of the movie tag attributes"
columns="Number of columns"
width="Resize the images to width"
space="Spacing between each grid cell" >
The panel tag acts just like the movie tag except that it merges all of the images into one image in a panelized or gridded fashion. It is column
oriented so you specify the number of columns:
<panel file="test.gif" width="400" columns="2" space="10"/>
< html > Create an image from rendered html
<html
file="output image file"
fromfile="Optional name of file to read in html"
width="Fixed width of image" >
The html tag allows you to specify html that is rendered into an image. It acts just like the image tag in that in can contain image manipulation
commands. The html is either from a file (specified by the fromfile attribute) or contained in a CDATA block:
<html file="foo.png"> <![CDATA[ hello there <hr> This is my test ]]> <matte bottom="50"
background="red"/> </html>

Images Manipulation
There are a set of tags that can be contained by both the image and movie tags that support processing of the image. Most of these tags work on
the initial image and act as a filter pipeline. For example, the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90"/> <matte
bottom="150"/> </image>
Will generate an image from the main display. It will then clip the image at the given lat/lon bounding box and then add a matte with spacing of
150 pixels at the bottom of the image. It will then write out the image to the file test.png.
You can modify this behavior in a variety of ways. For example, the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90" copy="true"
file="clippedimage.gif"/> <matte bottom="150"/> </image>
will clip the original image but not alter it (the copy="true") and then will write out the clipped image to the given file. The original image will be
passed to the matte tag which will matte it.
The image manipulation tags can be nested. e.g. the ISL:
<image file="test.png"> <clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90" copy="true"
file="clippedimage.gif"> <matte bottom="150"/> <write file="somefile.jpg"/>
<transparent color="black"/> </clip> <matte bottom="150"/> </image>
Will clip a copy of the image, matte the copy, write out the matted image as somefile.jpg, set the color black to be transparent and then write it
out as clippedimage.gif. The original image is then matted and written out as test.png.
< clip> Clip an image
<clip
north="latitude"
south="latitude"
east="longitude"
west="longitude"
top="pixels or %"
bottom="pixels or %"
left="pixels or %"
right="pixels or %"
display="The id of a display which we use its data's map projection to clip with" >
The clip tag allows you to clip the image. The clipping can either be defined in lat/lon coordinates, with x/y image coordinates or from the
projection used from a display. The image coordinates can be specified as percentages.

Clip in image space:
<clip top="10" bottom="0" left="10%" right="0"/>
Clip in lat/lon space:
<clip north="40" south="30" east="-80" west="-90"/>
If there is a display attribute defined then we get the lat/lon bounds of its data to clip with. Use the display control Properties dialog to set the id
that you reference in the ISL.
Clip using a display id:
<clip display="displayid"/>
< matte > Matte an image
<matte
background="color name or r,g,b"
top="pixel spacing"
bottom="pixel spacing"
left="pixel spacing"
right="pixel spacing"
space="pixel spacing"
hspace="pixel spacing"
vspace="pixel spacing" >
The matte tag allows you to add a space around any of the sides of an image. e.g:
<matte top="100" bottom="20"/>
You can also simply specify a space , hspace (horizontal space), or vspace (vertical space) attributes:
<matte space="10"/> <matte hspace="20"/> <matte vspace="20"/>
You can also specify a background color. The color can be a named color or a comma separated list of red/green/blue values:
<matte top="100" background="black"/> or: <matte top="100" background="red,green,blue
values"/>
< overlay> Annotate an image with text or a logo
<overlay
image="file or url to image"
text="text to draw"
place="rectangle point on base image"
anchor="rectangle point on overlay"
fontsize="font size for text"
fontface="font face for text"
color="color for text" >
The overlay tag allows you to add an icon or text as an image overlay. You can either specify and image or text. The place and anchor tags
specify the location of the overlay. They take the form: "rectpoint,offsetx,offsety" Where rectpoint is a point on a rectangle:
UL UM UR ML MM MR LL LM LR Where U=upper,M=middle,L=lower R=right,L=left
The offsetx and offsety are optional. The idea is you define a point on the base image, e.g., the upper left corner ("ul"). Then you define an anchor
point on the overlay that will be placed at the place point. So for example, if you wanted the upper left corner of the image overlay to be drawn 10
pixels right and 20 pixels below the upper left corner of the base image then you would do:
place="UL,10,20" anchor="UL"
If you wanted some text overlay to be placed so that its bottom center was in the middle of the image, 30 pixels from the bottom of the image you
do:
place="LM,0,-30" anchor="LM"
If you wanted some overlay to be placed so that its upper right was placed at the center of the image you do:
place="M" anchor="UR"
< displaylist> Render the display list
<displaylist
valign="'bottom' or 'top'"
mattebg="<color> If defined then we matte the image with the given color the size that the display list takes up"
fontsize="optional font size"
fontface="optional font face">
The displaylist tag renders the display list (normally shown at the bottom of the view) directly into the image. The text rendering is a bit higher
quality because we are using direct Java drawing code and not the 3D rendering. Also, you can matte an image and then render the list of displays
in the matted area.
You will want to turn off the visibility of the display list for the view (under View->Show->Display List menu) when you save the bundle.
< show> Show the current image in a dialog

<show
message="optional message to show">
You can use the show tag inside an image or movie tag to show the current image in a dialog. This allows you to see what is going on and debug
your isl image generation.
< resize > Resize an image
<resize
width="pixels or percent""
height="pixels or percent" >
The resize tag allows you to resize an image. You specify either a width or a height:
<resize width="200"/> <resize height="150"/>
The width or height can also be a percentage:
<resize width="50%"/> <resize height="10%"/>
< thumbnail > Generate a thumbnail of an image
<thumbnail
file="image file name"
width="pixels or percent"
height="pixels or percent" >
The thumbnail tag is just like the resize tag except that it will also write out the image. e.g:
<thumbnail width="50%" file="thumbnail.png"/>
< write> Write out an image
<write
file ="file to write to" >
The write tag allows you to write out an intermediate image file at any time.
<write file="somefile.png"/>
< colorbar> Add a color bar to an image
<colorbar
width="bar width"
height="bar height"
orientation="tick mark location, 'right', 'left', 'bottom', 'top'"
tickmarks="number of tick marks"
interval="interval value"
values="comma separated list of values"
place="rectangle location"
anchor rectangle location="showlines"
'true' or 'false', draw tick lines="linecolor"
line color=""" >
The colorbar tag allows you to add a color bar from the color tables in the layer controls. Currently, it does not do a perfect job when there are
more than one color tables present.
The orientation attribute specifies where the tick marks are drawn, e.g., to the left, right, top or bottom of the color bar. This also implicitly
specifies the horizontal (top, bottom) or vertical (right, left) orientation of the color bar. Note, placing a vertical color bar is a bit tricky.
You can specify how ticks are drawn. You can give a number of tickmarks, a value interval or a specific list of values.
The location of the color bar is defined using the anchor and place points as described for the overlay tag.
Here is an example that loads a bundle, creates an image, mattes the image and then shows the color bar of a display with id "planview". "

display="planview" orientation="left" tickmarks="3" width="20" height="400"
showlines="true" anchor="MR" place="MR" showunit="true"/> </image> </isl>
colorbar.isl
That makes:

< kmlcolorbar> Write a colorbar into the kmz file
<kmlcolorbar
width="width of color bar image"
height="height of color bar image"
file="file to write color bar image to"
space="extra padding around image"
suffix="label suffix - can include "%unit%&quot"
kml.name="Name used in kml for this image"
kml.overlayXY.x="see below"
kml.overlayXY.y="see below"
kml.overlayXY.xunits="see below"
kml.overlayXY.yunits="see below"
kml.screenXY.x="see below"
kml.screenXY.y="see below"
kml.screenXY.xunits="see below"
kml.screenXY.yunits="see below">
The kmlcolorbar tag acts just like the colorbar tag but is intended to generate a separate color bar image (written to the file specified by the file
attribute) and include it into a KMZ file.
All of the kml. attributes are simply passed into the generated KML file and are used to place the image into Google Earth. These attributes are
the attributes and tags in the KML. For example, the attribute kml.overlayXY.x ends up being the x attribute of the overlayXY tag in the KML. See
here http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html#screenoverlay for more info on the KML.
Here is an example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <isl debug="true" loop="1" offscreen="true"
sleep="60.0minutes"> <bundle clear="true" file="${islpath}/testtwoview.xidv"
wait="true"/> <image file="${islpath}/test.kmz"> <kmlcolorbar width="400" height="20"

kml.overlayXY.x="0" kml.overlayXY.y="1" kml.overlayXY.xunits="fraction"
kml.overlayXY.yunits="fraction" kml.screenXY.x="10" kml.screenXY.y="1"
kml.screenXY.xunits="pixels" kml.screenXY.yunits="fraction"/> </image> </isl>
kmlcolorbar.isl
< transparent > Set transparency on an image
<transparent
color="color to set to transparent" >
The transparent tag allows you to set a particular color in an image to be transparent.
<transparent color="black"/> or: <transparent color="red,green,blue"/>

< backgroundtransparent> Set transparency on an image. Use the background color of the view.
The backgroundtransparent tag allows you to use the background color of the view as the transparent color in the image..
<backgroundtransparent/>
< split> Split an image into sub-images
<split
file ="base file name"
columns="number of columns"
rows="number of rows" >
The split tag splits up an image by a given number of rows and columns. The file attribute should contain properties for each image: ${row},
${column} and ${count}.

Writing Text Files
< output> Write output to file
<output
file ="the file to write to"
template="inline text of 'file:filename' of the template file"
fromfile="filename to read contents from"
text="text to output" >
The output tag allows you to generate text files. For example, this could be used to generate html pages, xml files, etc.
The output tag is used in two modes. First it is used to define the output file name, and possibly some templates. Then, the output tag is used to
write text output into that file.
You can write text a number of ways:
<isl> <output file="output.txt"> <output text="Some text to write"/> <!-- Read in the
contents of the file. Apply properties to the name and the contents --> <output
fromfile="${islpath}/file.txt"/> <output>Some more text</output> <output><![CDATA[ Some
text in a CDATA Section. This allows you to have " and < without escaping the in the
xml >]]></output> </output> </isl>
output.isl
To be even more complicated the output tag can specify templates to write into. For example, in output1.isl below, we are writing an output1.txt
file. Its template has some text and a ${text} macro. The text macro corresponds to the text that gets written into the template:text template. The
two following output tags use the template:text template, writing in the values of the thetext attribute.
<isl> <output file="output1.txt" template="Here is the text: ${text}"
template:text="${thetext} "> <output template="text" thetext="The text I am writing"/>
<output template="text" thetext="More text I am writing"/> </output> </isl>
output1.isl
The result of running this is:
Here is the text: The text I am writing More text I am writing
Here we have two different entry templates, place1 and place2.
<isl> <output file="output2.txt" template="Place 1 text: ${place1} Place 2 text:
${place2}" template:place1="${value1} -- ${value2} " template:place2="
${someothervalue} " > <output template="place1" value1="the value 1" value2="the value
2"/> <output template="place2" someothervalue="some value"/> <output template="place2"
someothervalue="some other value"/> </output> </isl>
output2.isl
The result of running this is:
Place 1 text: the value 1 -- the value 2 Place 2 text: some value some other value
Here we are generating an html file showing the thumbnail images that are generated with links to the actual image and a caption for each
thumbnail:
<isl> <bundle file="test.xidv"/> <pause/> <output file="images.html"
template="file:template.html" template:header="${text}"
template:imagehtml="file:imagetemplate.html"> <output template="header" text="Here are
the images"/> <image file="test1.png"> <thumbnail file="test1thumb.png" width="25%"/>
</image> <output template="imagehtml" thumb="test1thumb.png" image="test1.png"
caption="Test1"/> <image file="test2.png"> <thumbnail file="test2thumb.png"
width="25%"/> </image> <output template="imagehtml" thumb="test2thumb.png"
image="test2.png" caption="Test2"/> <image file="test3.png"> <thumbnail
file="test3thumb.png" width="25%"/> </image> <output template="imagehtml"
thumb="test3thumb.png" image="test3.png" caption="Test3"/> </output> </isl>
output3.isl
In this example the templates are defined as files: template.html :
<html> <body> ${header} ${imagehtml} </body>
and imagetemplate.html .
<a href="#TARGET_${image}_FILE"><img border="0" src="${thumb}"></a> ${caption} <p>

Scripting with Jython
Jython and ISL
McIDAS-V also supports writing scripts in Jython. This means that you can create a Jython script that includes calls to special methods (defined
below), and also does "normal" Jython things.
Please Note: Some of the APIs described below will likely change in the coming months!
To start with, here is an example Python script. This example script loads a bundle in the background containing a loop of images. It then saves
an image and a movie. The image saved is the first image of the loop. At this point, each individual image within a loop can not be saved through
this method.
Scripting in Jython allows for flexibility and a more "programming" flavor for McIDAS-V scripting, though you can still do much of the
functionality using Jython that you can do using ISL. The benefit of the ISL is that it is more declarative and requires (hopefully) less knowledge
of programming.
To run McIDAS-V with a Jython script, do:
runMcV -islfile your-script.py
Below, each of the available methods in the Jython scripting interface will be described.
setOffScreen(value)
If you want to do your rendering in the "background", then the value should be set to 1 (true). If you want the window(s) to pop-up, set the
value to 0 (false).
setDebug(value)
To enable some debug during your development, set the value to 1 (true).
loadBundle(filename, data_files)
Loads a bundle with the given filename . You may also provide a dictionary of datasource:file items similar to the ISL setfiles .
pause()
Pause until all displays have been created. This is useful between loadBundle() and writeImage() for example.
writeImage(filename, parameters, quality)
Write out an image file. The filename should have the file extension of the type of image file you want to write (.jpg, .gif, .png).
The parameters variable is a string that contains any parameter information (see the ISL description of parameters) It is in the form:
"clip north=40; matte background=green top=20; resize height=300 width=300"
The quality value is 1.0 for the best, down to 0.0 for, well, no quality at all...
writeMovie(filename, parameters) Write out the display as a movie. The filename should have the file extension of the type of image file
you want to write (.mov)
The parameters variable is a string that contains any parameter information (see the ISL description of parameters) It is in the form:
"clip north=40; matte background=green top=20; resize height=300 width=300"
An alternative way to get an Image, manipulate it and then save it:
getImage()
resizeImage(image, width, height)
matteImage(image, color, top, bottom, left, right)
df = findDisplayControl(id) then "dc.getImage()"
writeImageToFile(image, filename)

Sharing
Sharing is a mechanism to share control operations between two or more displays. For example, you can have one animation control control
animation in two windows at once.
For sharing animation in two windows, such as in the main McIDAS-V view window and a vertical cross section control, open the animation
properties dialog in each animation control by clicking on the i icon. Toggle on the Shared box and click on Ok . Then using either animation
control will effect animation in both windows.
You can share other kinds of layer controls, such as sharing one selector line in vertical cross sections. This is toggled on by clicking on the Share
check box under the View menu in the control window.

Data Analysis
Formulas
Jython Methods
Derived Data
Jython Shell
Jython Library

Formulas
McIDAS-V provides techniques to make computations with data sources, and display the results. The simplest technique is using McIDAS-V
"formulas" which are named one-line mathematical expressions. The steps for computing and displaying an McIDAS-V formula are
Defining an McIDAS-V formula by name, description, and mathematical formula.
Saving the formula.
Selecting what kind of display to use.
Selecting exactly which particular data you want to use in the formula-based computation.
You can make formulas more powerful by writing methods (subroutines) in the Jython computer language, which is described in Jython Methods.
When you define an McIDAS-V formula, it is saved and will appear in future runs of your McIDAS-V.
To create a formula select the Tools->Formulas->Create Formula menu item. This brings up the Formula Editor dialog box used to define a
formula:

The minimal information you need to provide is the name of the formula and the actual formula.
If the formula name matches a name in the main Tools Menu Parameter defaults , then color tables and other settings may be automatically
assigned, which may or may not be desirable for you. For example, if you choose a formula named T its displays would get the color tables
associated with temperature.
In the formula itself you can use common mathematical operators much as +, -, * for multiply, / for divide, and ** for power. Other Jython
operations such as sqrt(a), max(b), pow(a,b), and sin(c) are available. In the Jython Methods section of the User Guide you will see how to write
complete complete multi-line functions or methods in Jython that you can call in one-line formulas.
The variable names in the formula definition, such as "NIR" in the figure above, are operands and do not need to exactly match any particular
parameter name in any data source; the association is made later, in the parameter selection step.
Do not use spaces in formula variable names, such as "wind speed." The formula is an expression in the Jython language. Start each variable name
with a letter.
It is best to use variable names that suggest the parameter data they represent, so that later you can easily remember what the variables should
represent. Use names like Temp500m, RelHum_surf, absvort, sst_jan, density, or whatever makes sense to you. If you use a variable names like
V1 and V2, then later when the formula requests which real parameter name goes with which variable name you may be puzzled which is which.
Variable names can have extra "syntactic sugar" attached to them that McIDAS-V uses for a variety of purposes. The "sugar" consists of a set of
name/value pairs contained in brackets ("[...]") after the variable name.
For example, normally variables are used to select and define data choices. You can also have variables that are simple text input from a user. For
example, evaluating the following expression:
someProcedure(someValue[isuser=true])
will result in a dialog box being shown to allow for the user to enter a text value (e.g., a number) for the variable someValue .
You can provide default values with:
someProcedure(someValue[isuser=true,default=some default])
You can specify the types of data that can be selected for a variable with the categories name. e.g.:
someProcedure(someDataValue[categories=param:ALTITUDE])
If you want multiple data categories separate them with a ";":
someProcedure(someDataValue[categories=param:ALTITUDE;param:elevation])
If you only want to select 3D grids do:

someProcedure(someDataValue[categories=GRID-3D-*])
If you only want to select 3D or 2D grids do:
someProcedure(someDataValue[categories=GRID-3D-*;GRID-2D-*"])
You can also specify a regular expression pattern that is used to pre-select the first data choice whose description matches the pattern.
someProcedure(someValue[pattern=some_pattern])
In the advanced section you can enter a description of the formula, its group or category and you can define what types of displays are applicable
for the given formula (the default is to be able to use all displays).
The group is used to display the formula in the Field Selector window and can be any alphanumeric text including spaces, numbers, and
punctuation characters. Hyphens ("-") define sub-categories.
To save the formula, click on Add formula . A new entry appears in the selector panel. By right clicking on the formula entry in the Field Selector
window you can edit the formula. To remove a formula, click on Remove Formula in the pull down menu.

Different data sources and automatic navigation
McIDAS-V hides much of the computational complexity. You can write a simple formula such as (CT*1.8 + 32.0) - dewptF and McIDAS-V will
automatically apply the calculation to every element in large 3D grids referred to as CT and dewptF. No loops over grid points are needed; and
you don't even need to know anything about how the grid is defined, mapped on the Earth, or the data format. You can even use different sources
for the individual parameters, for example, CT can come from an Eta model output grid and dewptF from your own local weather model. The two
grids need hot have the same grid point locations nor the same areal coverage. The results are computed in the area of overlap, on the grid points
locations of the first grid. Interpolation is automatically applied where needed.

Creating a Display with a Formula
Using a formula as the data when creating a display is just like using any other data. You select the formula entry in the Field Selector window,
the list of applicable displays will be shown and you create the display.
When you create a display McIDAS-V needs to know what actual data should be bound to the operands within your formula. A Field Selector
window will appear that allows you to select the actual data for each operand. You can select parameters from more than one data source for use
in a single formula, for example, you can pick the same parameter from data sources of different times to compute a time difference in the
parameter.

Open the data source to see the names of parameters available. Click on the parameter needed for each variable. Then click on OK. The result of
the formula is computed, for every data point in the source, and the result shown in the view window.

Description of Formulas - Image Filters
The follow describes each formula included in the Image Filter Formulas section of McIDAS-V.
Cloud Image Filter (replace, constant)
This formula applies a cloud filter to an image by comparing each element to the elements of another image. Use this filter to mask off a portion
of the first source image.

then ddataset = sdataset1
else ddataset = replace
Gradient Image Filter
This formula applies a gradient filter to the source image.
Equation for each ddataset element:
ddataset = ABSOLUTE(sdataset n - ( sdataset n+1 ) )
High Pass 2D Image Filter
This formula applies a two-dimensional high-pass filter to each element in the source image. It eliminates low-frequency deviations by clustering
them around the distribution's midpoint. A sample average is calculated by the program using values in a two-dimensional region around the
source element.
Equation for each ddataset element:
ddataset = ( sdataset - (sample average ) + (sample midpoint) )
High Pass Image Filter (radius, leak)
This formula applies a one-dimensional high-pass filter to each element in the source image. It eliminates low-frequency deviations by clustering
them around the distribution's midpoint. A sample average is determined using values on either side of the source element and the percentage of
filter efficiency.
Input parameters:
radius

sample length surrounding the source element; used for sample average (default=50)

efficiency filter efficiency (default=100)
Equation for each ddataset element:
ddataset = ( sdataset - (sample average) + (sample midpoint) )

Hole Image Filter (brkpoint1, brkpoint2)

brkpoint1 low end breakpoint value (default=minimum sdataset value)
brkpoint2 high end breakpoint value (default=maximum sdataset value)
Equation for each ddataset element:
if ( brkpoint1 < sdataset < brkpoint2 )
then ddataset = (average of the surrounding sdataset element values)
else ddataset = sdataset
Low Pass 2D Image Filter (linecoef, elecoef)
This formula applies a two-dimensional low-pass filter to each element in the source image. It eliminates high-frequency deviations by replacing
the source image data values with the average of the values in the sample defined with the line and element coefficients.
Input parameters:
linecoef

line coefficient; 0.0 < linecoef < 1.0 (default=0.5)

elecoef

element coefficient; 0.0 < elecoef < 1.0 (default=linecoef)

Equation for each ddataset element:
ddataset = (sample average)
Low Pass Image Filter (radius, leak)
This formula applies a one-dimensional low-pass filter to each element of the source image. It eliminates high-frequency deviations by replacing
the source image data values with the average of the values on either side of the source element. The sample average is determined using the
percentage of filter efficiency.
Input parameters:
radius

sample length in pixels surrounding the source element; used for sample average (default=50)

leak

filter efficiency (default=100)

Equation for each ddataset element:
ddataset = (sample average)
Replace Image Filter (replaceVal, bline, eline, belem, eelem)
This formula replaces selected elements in the defined region of the source image with the specified replacement value.
Input parameters:
replaceVal replacement value (default=0)
bline

beginning line in the source image region (default=first line)

eline

ending line in the source image region (default=last line)

belem

beginning element in the source image region (default=first element)

eelem

ending element in the source image region (default=last element)

Equation for each ddataset element:
if sdataset lies outside the region defined by the line and element ranges
then ddataset = sdataset
else ddataset = replaceVal
Shot Image Filter (bline, eline, pdiff)
This formula cleans an image by applying a shot noise filter to each element in the source image. Each element is compared to the elements on
either side and replaced if the values are significantly different.
Input parameters:
bline

beginning line in the source image to clean (default=first line)

eline

ending line in the source image to clean (default=last line)

pdiff

maximum percentage of the product range to allow before a new value for the pixel is derived using
the
average of two adjacent pixels (default=15)

Equation for each ddataset element:
if the difference between sdataset and the surrounding elements is < pdiff
then ddataset = sdataset
else ddataset = (average of the surrounding sdataset element values)

FAQ
Q. What is Jython?
A. Jython is a Java implementation of the Python language. It is used within McIDAS-V for data analysis. Complex routines can be written in
the McIDAS-V Jython editor and called from the McIDAS-V Formulas .
Q. How do I learn to write Jython?
A. There are a number of books available on the language as well as a number of web sites:
http://www.python.org
http://www.jython.org
Q. How does Jython work with my data in McIDAS-V?
A. McIDAS-V uses the VisAD package as as an underlying data model. There is a VisAD/Jython Tutorial available.
Q. Creating/Removing library files
A. To create a new file use the File->New Jython Library... menu. To remove the currently displayed library file use the File->Remove

Library menu.
Q. Calling procedures from formulas
A. When creating a formula with the Formula Editor you can call any routines you have defined in the Jython Library. Simply enter the
procedure name in the formula with appropriate arguments, if any. For example a formula might be "convertCToF(atemp)". When evaluating
the formula for display, this will call the routine that you define in the Jython Library.
Q. Create a formula from my procedure
A. Right click on a procedure definition within the McIDAS-V editor window and choose Make formula for .... This is a convenience that
brings up the Formula creation dialog with a call to that procedure.
As another convenience you can also right-click on the Formula: field of the Formula Editor to show the Insert Procedure Call menu. This
lists all of the currently defined procedures in the other Jython libraries.

Derived Data
McIDAS-V uses the formula mechanism to automatically create "derived" quantities based on the fields in a particular data source. When the data
source is read in, the list of derived quantities is evaluated against the list of variables in the data. Users can define their own derived quantities
by:
Defining an McIDAS-V formula by name, description, and mathematical formula.
Using special operators (D1, D2, ... DN) for the variable names.
Specifying the binding between the special operators and the parameters names or system aliases.
Saving the formula and loading or reloading a data source.
See the Formulas section for an overview of creating McIDAS-V formulas.
Create a formula select the Tools->Formulas->Create Formula menu item. This brings up the Formula Editor dialog box used to define a
formula:

The minimal information you need to provide is the name of the formula and the actual formula.
You can use the Derived tab in the Formula Editor to set the bindings between formula parameters and fields/aliases. You need to check the
Create derived quantities checkbox to enable this as a system formula.

The parameters to be bound are denoted by operands D1, D2, D3, etc in the formula itself. If you need user input, you can use other field names
and the users will be prompted to supply those fields.
You can define the bindings for the operands using parameter groups or by specifying the parameters to use. Right clicking in the Parameter
input field will pop up a menu that allows you to select system parameter aliases or parameters from fields loaded into McIDAS-V already.
Categories specify the types of data that are allowed in this formula. For example, if your derived formula is valid only for 3D Grids, you can
select that category from the popup list. Access the list by right clicking in the Categories input fields.
You can define specific output categories if the type of the data that the formula creates is different from the categories that the input operands
require. In general, the output categories will be the same as the input categories. For more information on data categories, see the Formulas
section.

To save the formula, click on Add formula . A new entry appears in the Fields panel of the Field Selector. If you want to apply the formula to an
existing data source, you need to reload that data source. Right click on the name of the data source in the Data Sources section of the Field
Selector and select Reload Data.

Jython Shell
The Jython Shell is an interactive command line interface to the McIDAS-V Jython interpreter that allows the user to type in arbitrary jython to
evaluate. It is brought up with the Tools->Formulas->Jython Shell menu.

The User Interface

The Jython shell consists of an output window on the top and an input field on the bottom. The user enters Jython into the input field. When
"return" or "Evaluate" is pressed the Jython is evaluated and any ouput is shown in the output window.
The icons shown with every Jython entry in the output window allow you to select the particular Jython or re-evaluate it.
The entry window can be expanded with the down arrow icons on the right.
Pressing the "Up" arrow and "Down" arrow (also control-P, control-N) in the entry field goes up and down through the history of commands.
Right clicking in the entry field brings up a menu that allows you to:
Add an entry from the history.
Insert the identifier for a display control type when creating a display.
Insert the text of a procedure call from any of the McIDAS-V Jython Library modules. Note: the shell utilities module has a number of
useful Jython shell related commands. Click here for more information.
Insert any of the defined McIDAS-V actions (e.g., Edit color table, Show window, etc.)

Menus
File
Export Commands Allows you to take the commands that have been entered and add them into the Jython Library to be used to
create a fixed procedure.
Save History Writes out the history of commands the have been entered. When you restart McIDAS-V those commands will be in
your history.
List History Shows the history of commands in the output window.
List Variables Shows all global Jython variables defined.
Edit
Clear All Clears the history and anything in the output window.
Clear Output Clears the output window.
Auto-select Operands When selected, this causes the Jython shell to analyze every command entered to see if there are references to
variables that have not been set. It will bring up the Data Selection dialog to allow you to choose the fields to use.

Site Configuration
You can customize McIDAS-V for yourself and your site in a variety of ways. McIDAS-V is configured through a set of resource files. These are
typically e Xtensible M arkup Language (XML) files that define things such as:
Color tables
The data chooser user interface
The derived quantities and formulas
Jython libraries
Display defaults for parameters
Parameter aliases
Help tips
Projections
Available data sources
Available displays
Where the favorite bundles are
Maps
Station models
Most of these files (with the exception of the chooser UI, help tips, data sources, displays and favorite bundle locations) are created through
facilities provided by McIDAS-V (e.g., color table editor, formula editor, etc.)
By default McIDAS-V looks in three places for the resources it uses to configure itself:
User path . This is the ~user/.metapps/<Application name> directory that gets created for each user. Note: the "Application name" is usually
"DefaultIdv"
Site path . This is the file directory or URL directory that can be defined as a command line argument, -sitepath, or through the user
preferences dialog.
System path . This is a directory, /ucar/unidata/idv/resources, in the system Java jar files.
When McIDAS-V first starts up it reads the system properties file: mcv.properties . This defines some basic information (e.g., title, splash icon,
ADDE servers, etc.) as well as defining where to find other properties files. By default it looks for idv.properties files under the site path and the
user path:
idv.properties = %SITEPATH%/idv.properties;%USERPATH%/idv.properties;
You can also specify one or more properties files as command line arguments:
-properties your_properties_file
McIDAS-V processes these properties files in order, with properties defined in later files overriding those defined previously.
Once the properties have been processed McIDAS-V initializes its resources by reading in one or more resource definition files. We call these
files "RBI" files - ( Resource Bundle for the I DV). These are XML files, the locations of which are defined by the idv.resourcefiles property:
idv.resourcefiles=%USERPATH%/idv.rbi;%SITEPATH%/idv.rbi;%IDVPATH%/idv.rbi
When you first run McIDAS-V, the application, as a thoughtful convenience, writes out an example RBI file into your local .metapps/DefaultIdv
directory. This example file has documentation that describes how to add in new resources.
These RBI files define the location of different collections of resources. For example, from the system RBI file, idv.rbi, we have the entry that
defines where McIDAS-V can find the XML files that define the color tables:
<resources name="TARGET_SiteConfiguration__idv.resource.colortables"> <resource
location="%USERPATH%/colortables.xml"/> <resource location="%SITEPATH%/colortables.xml"/>
<resource location="%IDVPATH%/colortables.xml"/> </resources>
This says to look for colortables in the user path, sitepath and McIDAS-V system path. McIDAS-V uses the first entry in this list as the file path
to write out color tables that are created using the color table editor.
Note: as a further complexity, errr, convenience, if there is a property defined in the properties file which is the resource name then McIDAS-V
just uses the value of the property (it treats it as a semi-colon delimited list of paths) as the resources and ignores the resources in the RBI file.
So, for example, if you had a property:
idv.resource.colortables=%USERPATH%/colortables.xml;http://yourwebsite.edu/specialtables.xml
then McIDAS-V would only load in these colortables.
Using the RBI file, what are the set of steps you need to take to configure your site to use a set of special color tables that you have created. What
you would do is bring up McIDAS-V. Create the color tables. They would get saved off in your local .metapps/DefaultIdv directory in the file
colortables.xml (as defined by the resource paths defined in the default RBI). You could simply copy that file to an area on your web site or on a
shared file system that is pointed to by the McIDAS-V sitepath. Now, your users simply need to define the sitepath and they will naturally pick up
the color tables you have created.
Most site configuration can be accomplished through the default user/site/system resource locations. However, you can modify the RBI file to
include other resources. For example, you could add in an entry:
<resource location="http://yourwebsite.edu/specialcolortables.xml"/>
to make available some special color tables at a particular URL.

Plugins
McIDAS-V plugins are a way to add to or modify the functionality of McIDAS-V. Plugins can range from adding new resources (e.g., color
tables, layout models, maps) to changing the entire application. Plugins are typically Java JAR archive files that can contain a set of McIDAS-V
resources and Java code. They are kept in a special directory on disk and are loaded at run time.

Plugin Command Line Arguments
You can load a plugin (one time only) with the:
-plugin <plugin file or URL>
command line argument.
You can install a plugin with the:
-installplugin <plugin file or URL>
command line argument.
You can start McIDAS-V without any plugins with the:
-noplugins
command line argument.

Plugin Manager
The Plugin Manager, accessed through the Tools->Plugins->Manage... menu, allows you to list, install and manage plugins.

Image 1: Plugin Manager
A list of the installed and available plugins is shown. The available plugins are those the McIDAS-V development team makes available through.
One can install plugins that are not in this list through the File->Install Plugin from File and File->Install Plugin from URL menu items. When
you install a plugin you will need to restart McIDAS-V for the plugin to take effect.
For installed plugins the Manager allows you to delete and reinstall the plugin. Note: When you delete a plugin it is only deleted when you exit
McIDAS-V.
The small binocular icon allows you to list the files that the plugin contains. This brings up the Plugin List dialog:

Image 2: Plugin List
You can view the contents of a file and/or extract a file through this dialog.

Plugin Creator
The Plugin Creator, accessed through the Tools->Plugins->Create... menu, allows you to create new plugins.
Note: This is a new facility within McIDAS-V and is a work in progress. Some things, like reading in a plugin, have yet to be implemented.
A plugin is a Java JAR file that contains a set of resource files. These resource files can include things like the color tables you have created,
projections, layout models, formulas, etc. The plugin manager supports both adding in a whole file (e.g., all of the color tables you have created)
as well as adding in individual resource objects (e.g., a specific color table you have created).

Adding Resources
To add in a file use the File->Add File menu. The file dialog will come up listing the contents of your local .metapps directory. This is where all
of the various resources that are created are stored. For example, if you wanted to include all of your color tables then add the colortables.xml
file.
You can also add individual resources through the File->Add Resource menus. You can also add resources through the various resource editors
(e.g., Jython Editor, Parameter Defaults,Parameter Aliases). Typically this facility is available through the editor's File menu.

Resources List
Each file or resource that is added into the Plugin Creator is listed under the Resource tab:

Image 1: Plugin Creator - Resource List
You can delete the selected resource in the list with the trash can button or the delete key.

Excludes
The excludes tab allows you to exclude system default resources. For example, in the below screen shot we are excluding color tables and
projections. When the plugin that is defined here is loaded into McIDAS-V the excludes will result in only the color tables and projections that are
defined in this plugin to be used.

Image 2: Plugin Creator - Exclude List

Properties
The Properties tab allows you to overwrite different properties McIDAS-V uses. This listing is broken up into three categories: User Interface,
Data and Miscellaneous.

Image 3: Plugin Creator - Properties

Writing the Plugin
To write the plugin simply click on the Write Plugin button. If you have not specified a plugin file name (i.e., a .jar file) you will be prompted. If
you also want to install the plugin to your local McIDAS-V plugins area select the Install checkbox. Note: You will need to restart McIDAS-V
for any installed plugins to take effect.

Plugin Jar Files
Note: This page is intended for someone who wants to create an McIDAS-V plugin. A description of installing and managing plugins is here.
McIDAS-V supports a plugin architecture that allows for the easy extension and addition of functionality. A plugin is most commonly a Java Jar
file that contains a set of resource files (e.g., color tables) and/or Java class files. The plugins are stored on a local directory or could be loaded
form a web site. McIDAS-V processes the plugin Jar file at run time loading in the contained resources and code.

Basic Plugin
Lets suppose you have created a set of color tables and some Jython code that you want to make a plugin with. As described in the Site
Configuration docs McIDAS-V stores these user created files in <user home>/.metappps/DefaultIdv as colortables.xml and default.py.
To make these into a plugin, e.g., myplugin.jar, simply jar the the files (you need to get a Java SDK for this):
jar -cvf myplugin.jar colortables.xml default.py
Now this plugin can be distributed to others and loaded into their McIDAS-V environment.
So, you might ask how does McIDAS-V recognize these files in the plugin and treat them appropriately? McIDAS-V loads in a set of resources
(e.g., color tables, Python libraries). Each resource type is identified by a regular expression as shown in the resource list. In our example above
the file name colortables.xml matches the pattern for color table xml resources.
Now, what happens if you have some file whose name does not match a pattern? Say, you have a color table xml file called myspecialtables.xml
that you want to include in a bundle. In that case you can add a .rbi file, as described here, that defines this file as a resource:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <resourcebundle> <resources
name="TARGET_PluginJarFiles__idv.resource.colortables"> <resource
location="/myspecialtables.xml"/> </resources> </resourcebundle>
This acts as a table of contents for the plugin. Make sure that the location is not relative. Note: Jar files can contain directory trees. e.g.,
/tables/myspecialtables.xml. In this case just have the location point to:
... <resource location="/tables/myspecialtables.xml"/> ...

Including Code
You can also include code that implements certain functionality by just including the Java .class files in the Jar. When you do this you need to
include them like a normal class containing Jar file, i.e., the package structure of your code (e.g., edu.ucar.app.Test) needs to be reflected in the
directory structure of the Plugin Jar file:
/edu/ucar/app/Test.class
For a single class file this is not necessarily required but if there are multiple class files that have interdependency among themselves then you
will get into trouble if you don't follow this structure.
Now, what this code does can be anything and is best left up to the developer's guide.

Configuring Image Defaults
The defaults for the advanced settings of the Image Chooser is set for particular images through a configuration file. You can override the system
defaults by creating your own configuration file and placing it in the user directory or sitepath See the section on Site Configuration for more
information on the location of these directories. The configuration file (imagedefaults.xml) has the following format:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <imagedefaults> <default pattern="" key="" place=""
loc="" unit="" user="" band="" proj=""/> </imagedefaults>
The attributes that can be overridden are:
pattern dataset identifier (format: host:group/desc )
key
type of location (LINELE or LATLON)
place placement (ULEFT or CENTER)
loc
location of placement (line ele or lat lon)
size
resulting image size (lines eles)
mag magnification factor (lmag emag)
unit
default calibration unit
band band number
proj project number
user user id (case sensitive)
debug (true to print lots of debug information)
Except for pattern, key and debug, McIDAS-V uses the same keywords/syntax as McIDAS (longitudes are entered as degrees east, however). The
entries are hierarchical, so if you specify some defaults for the server, they apply to all datasets on that server unless overridden for specific
datasets.
Here are a few examples:
<imagedefaults> <default pattern="*" debug="true"/> <default
pattern="adde.ucar.edu:RTIMAGES/GE-IR" key="LATLON" place="CENTER" loc="40 -90" unit="BRIT"
user="foo" proj="9999"/> <default pattern="EUM_AD/M8" loc="46 10" band="9" unit="TEMP"
size="512 512"/> <default pattern="CIMSS/CTP" key="LATLON" loc="35 -100" mag="1 1"
unit="CTOP"/> <default pattern="GINICOMP/GSN8KVIS" key="LINELE" place="CENTER" loc="504 768"
size="504 768" mag="-2 -2"/> <default pattern="CCS039/G81KVIS" key="LINELE" place="ULEFT"
loc="0 0" size="ALL"/> </imagedefaults>

Adding in new GRIB tables
McIDAS-V can read Gridded Binary (GRIB) files in both GRIB-1 and GRIB-2 formats. Decoding GRIB files requires a set of lookup tables for
parameters, issuing centers, etc. McIDAS-V comes pre-configured to support commonly used tables, but regional models and modeling centers
may use tables that are not in the distribution.
You can add in specialized tables for both GRIB-1 and GRIB-2 using the steps below. Documentation on the format of the files can be found
here.
GRIB-1 tables
GRIB-2 tables

GRIB-1 tables
To add in new GRIB 1 tables, you will need to create a file listing the special tables and the special table files themselves.
To add in a new parameter file, McIDAS-V would need to have access to a file called grib1lookuptable.lst which would list the parameter table
(e.g.: gwctab_2.tab) and the parameter table itself.
The format of grib1lookuptable.lst is:
<center>:<subcenter>:<version>: <table location>
so it would look like:
57: 1: 2: gwctab_2.tab
gwctab_2.tab can be a relative or absolute path. The tables are in ncep format:
-1:57:-1:2 0:var0:undefined 1:PRES:Pressure [Pa] 2:PRMSL:Pressure reduced to MSL [Pa]
3:PTEND:Pressure tendency [Pa/s] 4:PVORT:Pot. vorticity [km^2/kg/s] 5:ICAHT:ICAO Standard
Atmosphere Reference Height [m] :GP:Geopotential [m^2/s^2] ...
(You can read more information about the format of this file and the parameter table here)
Once you've created this file, you would access it by putting the grib1lookuptable.lst in your <home>/.metapps/DefaultIdv directory and put the
corresponding table files where they are pointed to in the file. This can be a relative path or a web server. Alternatively, you could place the
grib1lookuptable.lst and associated parameter tables on a local web server and use McIDAS-V's sitepath parameter (startup option or user
preference) to point to the location where the files are.

GRIB-2 tables
To add in new GRIB 2 parameter, you would create a file named grib2lookuptable.lst which lists the parameters.
The format of grib2lookuptable.lst is:
<Discipline> <Category> <Parm #> <Name> <Units> <Desc>
Parameters are listed by row, fields are separated by tabs, so it would look like:
#Dis Cat Parm # Name Units Desc 0 0 0 Temperature K Temperature
(This is a sample table, the lines starting with # are not include in table.) (You can read more information about the format of this file and the
parameter table here)
Once you've created this file, you would access it by putting the grib2lookuptable.lst in your <home>/.metapps/DefaultIdv directory. Alternatively,
you could place the grib2lookuptable.lst on a local web server and use McIDAS-V's sitepath parameter (startup option or user preference) to point
to the location of the file.

McIDAS-V Special Data Formats
Text (ASCII) Point Data Format
Location XML Files
Image XML Files
Image Movie Files
XGRF Symbols

Text (ASCII) Point Data Format
If your point (in situ) data is not available in one of the file formats that McIDAS-V can handle, but you can output it into a column-oriented
ASCII text file, you may still be able to use the McIDAS-V displays. McIDAS-V supports reading in point observation data in a text comma
separated value (CSV) file format.
You need to specify the metadata of this point data. This can be done in two ways. First, the file can have two extra header lines that defines for
McIDAS-V the fields that are within the file and the types of the fields. The only other requirement is that there must be a latitude, longitude and
time field in the data. See below.
Secondly, if there are no metadata header lines defined, the Text Point Data Source will show the Metadata GUI described below .

Examples:
Comma separated numeric values
In the simplest form, each line line is an observation at one time and one location:
(index) -> (Time,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,PSL,GUS,SPD,DIR,TD,T) Time[fmt="yyyy-MM-dd
HH:mm:ss"],Latitude[unit="deg"],Longitude[unit="degrees
west"],Altitude[unit="m"],PSL[unit="hPa"],GUS[unit="m.s-1"],SPD[unit="m/s"],DIR[unit="deg"],
TD[unit="celsius"],T[unit="celsius"] 2007-01-07 16:00:00Z,32.9,117.1,145.0,1026.1,NaN,0.0,0.0,2.8,12.8 2007-01-07 16:00:00Z,48.3,92.5,341.0,1003.7,NaN,1.5,170.0,-2.0,-0.99 2007-01-07
16:00:00Z,36.8,98.7,449.0,1024.0,12.4,9.8,330.0,-3.0,3.0 2007-01-07
16:00:00Z,44.3,121.2,938.0,1030.1,NaN,2.1,110.0,-3.3,-1.7
Note also that the first line's structure is quite rigid -- you must have a variable (e.g., index , recNum ) that is the domain parameter; this should
map to the range values. The second line defines the formatting and units of the parameters. Unit names should be standard international unit
specifications (udunits compatible). A list of valid names can be found here. (A complete description of this format is contained in the VisAD
README.text file.)
Also note that you need to set the name of the variable for time as "Time", as well as the locations as "Latitude", "Longitude" and "Altitude" (if
needed).

Text fields
If you have text fields (i.e., non-numeric data) in your observation just do this:
(index) -> (Time,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,ST(Text),T) Time[fmt="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
z"],Latitude[unit="deg"],Longitude[unit="degrees
west"],Altitude[unit="m"],ST(Text),T[unit="celsius"] 2007-02-16 11:00:00
MST,32.9,117.1,145.0,CA ,20.6
Here we have a ST field (State from metars). Its field name is defined as "ST(Text)" and its entry in the second line is the same.

Time in multiple columns
If you have time fields that span multiple columns, you can use the colspan keyword:
(index) -> (IDN, Latitude, Longitude, Time, WDIR, WSPD, GST) IDN, Latitude[unit="deg"],
Longitude[unit="deg"], Time[fmt="yyyy MM dd HH mm" colspan="5"], WDIR[unit="deg" miss="MM"],
WSPD[unit="m/s" miss="MM"], GST[unit="m/s" miss="MM"] 41001 34.68 -72.66 2007 07 17 20 50 210
4.0 6.0 41004 32.5 -79.09 2007 07 17 20 50 210 6.0 MM 41008 31.4 -80.87 2007 07 17 21 50 170
7.0 8.0

Skipping columns
You can use the "skip" parameter if you want to ignore (not read) values in your text file that you don't want to use:
(recNum)->(Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, type(Text), time, turb_intensity)
Time[fmt=yyyyMMddHH], obtime, skip, type(Text), skip, skip, Latitude, Longitude[scale=-1],
Altitude[unit=ft], Altitude2[unit=ft], turb_intensity, skip 2004050100 0005 34 C210 1 T 38.82
92.22 7000 7000 0 -9 2004050100 0004 35 PA32 0 T 35.40 98.62 4000 4000 0 -9 2004050100 0008 58
A36 0 T 29.18 81.05 5000 5000 2 -9

Fixed values for several observations
If you have values (like time or location) that are fixed for several observations, you may use this construct:
(index) -> (Longitude,Latitude,Time,ST(Text),SPD,DIR,TD,T) Longitude[unit="degrees
west"],Latitude[unit="deg"],Time[fmt="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
z"],ST(Text),SPD[unit="m/s"],DIR[unit="deg"],TD[unit="celsius"],T[unit="celsius"] Longitude=117.1 Latitude=32.9 ST=MSN 2007-02-20 11:00:00 ST ,0.0,0.0,8.9,13.3 2007-02-20 12:00:00 ST
,0.0,0.0,11.9,15.0 Longitude=-89.4 Latitude=43.1 ST=DEN 2007-02-20 11:00:00 ST ,1.5,160.0,7.0,-2.0 2007-02-20 12:00:00 ST ,1.5,160.0,-7.0,-2.0 Longitude=-121.2 Latitude=44.3 ST=ORD
2007-02-20 11:00:00 ST ,10.8,230.0,-1.1,6.7

Loading into McIDAS-V
Finally, after you have created your file, you will want to tailor your McIDAS-V display in two ways:

1. Create a Layout (station) model for those variables using the McIDAS-V's " Tools->Layout Model Editor " menu
Then, when you run McIDAS-V to read your data:
1. Use Data Source Type as "Text Point Data files"
2. Use the "Point Data Plot" for the Display
3. Select your newly created Layout model

Using the Text Point Metadata Gui
If your text data does not have the metadata header lines the Text Point Data Source will show the following dialog which allows you to specify
the meta data.

Skipping lines
At the top a number of the initial lines from the text data are shown. The arrow keys allow you to specify the start line. For example, if you had
some other header information you can skip over those lines.
Specifying metadata
For each column of text data there is a row shown in the bottom of the dialog. This shows the sampled value and allows you to enter a name, unit,
date format, missing value and extra information. There are some names that McIDAS-V treats special: "Latitude", "Longitude", "Altitude", and
"Time". You must have at least Latitude, Longitude and Time specied.
The Unit/Date Format field allows you to specify the Unit for data fields and the date format. For text fields choose Misc->Text as the unit.
The Extra fields must be of the form:
name="value"
Don't forget the quotes!
Skipping columns
You can skip over certain columns by entering the Name: "skip"
Saving this as a preference
After all of your hard work to keep from having to do this again next time you load a new text point data of the form simply press the
"Preferences" button and select Save Current. This allows you to save these metadata settings and reapply them later using the "Preferences"
button.

Location XML Files
McIDAS-V supports a variety of location text file formats. All of these formats can be loaded through the File Chooser. Select the "Location"
data type.
Locations XML
CSV Format
GeoRSS Format

Locations XML
The main one format McIDAS-V uses is a custom locations xml format. This format still has some nomenclature from when it was atmospheric
science related (e.g. "stations"). A simple example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <stationtable
name="TARGET_LocationXml__Example"> <station name="TARGET_LocationXml__station 1"
lat="65:02:06" lon="-147:30:06" elev="790"/> <station name="TARGET_LocationXml__station
2" lat="40.3" lon="-107.5" elev="10"/> ... </stationtable>
The lat and lon attributes can be of the form:
+/- ddd:mm, ddd:mm:, ddd:mm:ss, ddd::ss, ddd.fffff ===> [+/-] ddd.fffff +/- ddd, ddd:, ddd::
===> [+/-] ddd +/- :mm, :mm:, :mm:ss, ::ss, .fffff ===> [+/-] .fffff +/- :, :: ===> 0.0 Any of
the above with N,S,E,W appended
The elev attribute is optional. By default it is in meters. You can override this default with an elevunit in the stationtable tag. e.g.:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <stationtable
name="TARGET_LocationXml__Example" elevunit="feet"> <station
name="TARGET_LocationXml__station 1" lat="65:02:06" lon="-147:30:06" elev="5340"/> ...
The station tags can have an id attribute as well:
<station id="APD" name="TARGET_LocationXml__Fairbanks/Pedro Dome" lat="65:02:06" lon="147:30:06" elev="790"/>
The station tags can also have any other attributes:
<station id="APD" name="TARGET_LocationXml__Fairbanks/Pedro Dome" st="AK" co="US"
lat="65:02:06" lon="-147:30:06" elev="790"/> <station id="FTG"
name="TARGET_LocationXml__Denver/Boulder" st="CO" co="US" lat="39:47:12" lon="104:32:45" elev="1675"/>
These can be displayed by the station model used in the Location Display Control.

CSV Format
Location data can be defined in a CSV (Comma Separated Value) format. The first line is a comma separated list of column names. There must
be columns that are latitude and longitude. These are denoted with (case insensitive):
latitude lat longitude lon long
Altitude is given by the column names:
alt altitude
The altitude value, if defined, is by default in meters. You can optionally specify a unit with the suffix: "[unit name]" (see example).
The first column that is found that is not one of the location columns is taken to be the name of the location.
Example:
Name,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,State Boulder,40,-107,5430[feet],CO Miami,30,-95,0[feet],FL
...

GeoRSS Format
McIDAS-V can also read GeoRSS formats. This is a geocoded RSS feed. An example is the USGS earthquake feed:
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/catalogs/eqs7day-M2.5.xml

Image XML Files
The Image Xml file format (.ximg) allows one to define collections of geolocated images (and also shapefiles). The simplest file can define one
geolocated image:
<image url="sboulder.jpeg" name="South Boulder-aerial photo" ullat="39.98890" ullon="105.22782" lrlat="39.98755" lrlon="-105.22548"/>
The url attribute can be an absolute or relative url or file path. The ullat , ullon, lrlat and lrlon attributes are the upper left and lower right lat/lon
of the image. It is assumed that the image is in a geographic (i.e., rectilinear, lat/lon) projection.

Collections
You can also define a collection of images:
<collection name="TARGET_ImageXml__Boulder Images"> <image url="sboulder.jpeg"
name="South Boulder-aerial photo" ullat="39.98890" ullon="-105.22782" lrlat="39.98755"
lrlon="-105.22548"/> <image url="bouldertopo.jpeg" ullat="40.06654" ullon="-105.34710"
lrlat="39.98040" lrlon="-105.19676" name="Boulder topo"/> <image url="bigtopo.jpeg"
ullat="40.22807" ullon="-106.66437" lrlat="39.54718" lrlon="-105.45623" name="Mountains
topo"/> </collection>
Collections can contain other collections:
<collection name="TARGET_ImageXml__My Images"> <collection
name="TARGET_ImageXml__Madison Images"> <image url="madison_aerial.jpeg"
ullat="43.09444" ullon="-89.52626" lrlat="43.01143" lrlon="-89.36579" name="Madison
aerial"/> <image url="madison_topo.jpeg" ullat="43.09444" ullon="-89.52626"
lrlat="43.01143" lrlon="-89.36579" name="Madison topo"/> </collection> <collection
name="TARGET_ImageXml__Boulder Images"> <image url="sboulder.jpeg" name="South Boulderaerial photo" ullat="39.98890" ullon="-105.22782" lrlat="39.98755" lrlon="-105.22548"/>
</collection> </collection>
There is also a shape tag for defining shape files:
<collection name="TARGET_ImageXml__Shapes"> <shape url="boulder_roads.zip"
name="TARGET_ImageXml__Boulder roads"/> <shape url="boulder_rivers.zip"
name="TARGET_ImageXml__Boulder rivers"/> </collection>

Grouping
The group tag allows you to group a set of images in time or space:
<group name="TARGET_ImageXml__group of images" format="yyyyMMddhhmm" ullat="39.991856"
ullon="-105.226944" lrlat="39.989426" lrlon="-105.222656"> <image date="200610011000"
url="sketch.jpg"/> <image url="map.jpg" date="200610011100"/> </group>
The format attribute defines the date/time format of the date attributes. The location attributes (ullat,ullon, etc.) can be defined both in the group
tag as well as in each individual image tag.
If there are no date attributes then the group of images are aggregated together, each potentially covering a different area.

Images in 3D Space
One is not limited to just specifying the positions of the upper left and lower right corners of the image. There is support for defining the latitude
and longitude for any of the four corners of the image:
<image url="image.jpeg" name="Image" ullat="40" ullon="-100" lllat="30" lllon="-100"
urlat="50" urlon="-90" lrlat="30" lrlon="-90" />
One can also specify the altitude of any of the points. The unit specification is not required and will default to meters.
<image url="image.jpeg" name="Image" ullat="40" ullon="-100" ulalt="20000[feet]"
lllat="30" lllon="-100" llalt="0[feet]" urlat="50" urlon="-90" uralt="5000[feet]"
lrlat="30" lrlon="-90" lralt="0[feet]" />
McIDAS-V will try to fill in defaults. So, for example, if you wanted to have an image be a vertical cross section you could do:
<image url="topo.jpg" name="Image" ullat="40" ullon="-100" urlat="50" urlon="-90"
ulalt="20000[feet]" llalt="0[feet]"/>
Here, we define the lat/lon of the upper left and upper right of the image. We define the altitude of the upper left and lower left corners of the
image. The altitude of the upper right corner defaults to that of the upper left and the altitude of the lower right defaults to the lower left altitude.

Image Movie Files
McIDAS-V can display a sequence of time-stamped images as an animation.
One can write their own xml file and display the images within McIDAS-V using this xml format.
There are really two xml formats used. The first defines a set of imagesets :
<imagesets base="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/georesources/webcams/images"
name="TARGET_ImageMovie__McIDAS-V Webcams"> <group name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Rockies">
<imageset name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Boulder, CO" index="boulder_co/index.xml" lat="40.0"
lon="-105.27"/> <imageset name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Denver, CO"
index="denver_co/index.xml" lat="39.75" lon="-105"/> </group> <group
name="TARGET_ImageMovie__National Parks"> <imageset name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Theodore
Roosevelt National Park, ND" index="theodorerooseveltnationalpark_nd/index.xml"
lat="46.94889" lon="-103.43306"/> <imageset name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Big Bend National
Park,TX" index="bigbendnationalpark_tx/index.xml" lat="29.25" lon="-103.25"/> <imageset
name="TARGET_ImageMovie__Olympic National Park" index="olympicnationalpark/index.xml"
lat="48.26667" lon="-124.675"/> </group> ... </imagesets>
This is a "table of contents". The base attribute, if defined, is used as a url base to prepend to the urls defined by the index attributes. The lat and
lon attributes are optional and are used to locate the source of the movie on a map for the user to select.
Each of the index attributes refers to an images xml file of the form:
<images base="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/georesources/webcams/images/boulder_co"
name="Boulder, CO" group="Rockies" format="yyyyMMddHHmmz" desc="From:
http://9news.com"> <image time="200607251446GMT" file="image_200607251446GMT.jpeg"/>
<image time="200607251430GMT" file="image_200607251430GMT.jpeg"/> <image
time="200607251414GMT" file="image_200607251414GMT.jpeg"/> <image
time="200607251357GMT" file="image_200607251357GMT.jpeg"/> <image
time="200607251344GMT" file="image_200607251344GMT.jpeg"/> ... </images>
The images tag defines a base attribute (optional, used to prepend to any image urls), a name, a (optional) group and a date format and a
description ( desc ). Each image tag has a time in the format specified in the images tag and a file attribute which refers to some image. This may
be an absolute or relative url or file path.

XGRF Symbols
The drawing control can export and import its drawings in an xgrf format. In this format you can specify a symbol type. The symbol tag in the
xgrf has a symbol attribute, the value of which can be any of the below symbols.

Specifying data source type
If you load in a data source from the command line using the -data argument McIDAS-V tries to figure out what type of data it is by looking for
patterns in the file or url you specify. If it cannot determine the type McIDAS-V will prompt the user for the type.
You can add in a "type:" prefix to the argument that will specify the type with:
mcv -data type:somedatatype:the_file_or_url_to_the_data
The different values for the "somedatatype" are listed in here.

Performance Tuning
If you are running into issues with memory consumption or slow response of McIDAS-V, there are several things you can do.
The amount of memory used by McIDAS-V will depend on the size of the datasets you use and the types of displays. Datasets rendered as 2D
depictions (plan views - contours or color shaded displays) use much less memory than 3D displays (isosurfaces, cross sections). Large datasets
(images, dense grids) will use much more memory.
There are several features in McIDAS-V that allow you to more efficiently view large datasets:
Temporal/Spatial Subset of Data
Subsetting the data before display reduces the memory and display time
Memory allocation
Change the amount of memory allocated to McIDAS-V
Data Caching
Data caching uses more memory
Maximum grid/image size
Reducing the maximum size of a display can reduce the memory used
Fast Rendering
Fast Rendering reduces memory and time at the expense of accuracy
Parallel Rendering and Data Reading
Parallel Rendering and Data Reading can reduce data reading and rendering time

Temporal/Spatial Subset of Data
Some data sources allow you to subset the data temporally and spatially. You can set these properties for all fields in a dataset through the
Properties menu of the data source (double click on the Data Source in the Field Selector ) or you can set these for individual field using the tabs
in the lower right corner of the Field Selector . For more information, see the Data Source Properties section of McIDAS-V User's Guide.

Memory allocation
By default, McIDAS-V allocates 512 megabytes of maximum memory for Java. This is usually the optimum amount for a Windows system with
1 gigabyte of physical memory (RAM). Windows takes up half of that anyway and once Windows has to start swapping, performance severely
degrades. On a Linux system, you can probably get away with 700m for 1 Gb of memory as it does a much better job of swapping. All this also
depends on what else you are running on the machine and how much memory those applications use.
If your system has more than 1 Gb of memory, increasing the amount available to McIDAS-V can improve performance for displaying large
datasets. You change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V by editing the Maximum Heap Size in the Advanced tab of the Preferences by
selected Edit->Preferences... from the main menu. The new amount of memory will be saved and used in subsequent sessions. Do not use the
maximum amount of memory on your machine as some is needed for the operating system itself. If the system has to use swap memory,
performance will degrade as well. It is recommended to set this to no more than 1250 MB ( i.e. -Xmx1250m). For more information see the
Running McIDAS-V section of the McIDAS-V User's Guide.

Data Caching
By default, McIDAS-V caches the data used for a display in memory. If a field is used more than once for several displays, caching the data
prevents an additional reading from of the data from disk or a remote server. If you are only displaying/using a field (i.e. not using it for multiple
displays or calculations), you can keep McIDAS-V from caching it in memory. You can turn off data caching by unchecking the Cache data in
memory checkbox on the Data & Formats tab of the user preferences (accessible from the Edit->Preferences menu).

Maximum grid/image size
You can also set the maximum size of a grid or image that will be displayed. This will allow you to download a large image or grid, but it will be
re-sampled before displaying if it is larger than the maximum size you have asked for. You can set the maximum image/grid size under the Data
& Formats tab of the user preferences (accessible from the Edit->Preferences menu).

Fast Rendering
By default, McIDAS-V will try to adjust the data renderings to account for projection seams. This is computationally intensive in some cases and
slows down the display of data. When you set your preference to "Use Fast Rendering" (under the General tab of the user preferences ( Edit>Preferences menu)), McIDAS-V will not try to account for the projection seams. If you are displaying data in its native projection, this will
result in faster rendering of the data depiction. However, if you have several displays of data, each from a different data source and on a different
projection, you may see anomalies in the displays (spurious lines, portions of images). At that point, you can turn off fast rendering for a particular
display using the Edit->Properties menu of the Display Control for that display, or set your system preference back to not use fast rendering.
To change fast rendering options for maps, click here.

Parallel Rendering and Data Reading
If you are running McIDAS-V on a multi-core machine you can configure it to render individual time steps in parallel. You can also do remote
data reads in parallel. This typically results in a 50% reduction in overall data reading and rendering time.
There are 2 preferences in the Preferences->Advanced tab. One is the number of threads used for rendering. This defaults to the number of
processors on your machine. The second is the number of threads used for data reading. This defaults to 4.
For rendering McIDAS-V will render each time step in parallel. Note: since the rendering processes can allocate temporary memory it is possible
to exhaust the available memory if too many threads are running concurrently. Linear speedup with the number of cores available for rendering
(probably due to memory contention issues) is not seen, however a 40%-50% performance improvement is seen for complex rendering tasks (e.g.,
contouring).
The second preference is used when reading individual time steps of data from remote ADDE and OpenDAP servers. This parallelization takes
advantage of the multiple cores available on the remote server and somewhat the available bandwidth on the network. A linear speed up in
accessing remote data based on the number of cores on the remote server (ADDE or OpenDAP) has been seen. However, if you load the server
too much your performance is degraded, probably due to file system issues.

Building McIDAS-V from Source
Developers can download the source files for McIDAS-V and build it from scratch.
Before building McIDAS-V you need to first install Java and Java 3D on your system. You need to use the Java SDK, because the Java RunTime
Environment (JRE) does not contain the Java compiler (javac). You need to use a version of Java 1.6 or above. You can use either the Java 3D
SDK or JRE, version 1.3.x.
You will also need to install Ant 1.7 (http://ant.apache.org/) on your machine. Ant is similar to make - instead of a Makefile, Ant uses a
build.xml file. Be sure to follow the instructions for installing Ant, especially those for setting up environment variables.
Build steps:
1. Download the compressed source files from the McIDAS-V Download Page .
2. Uncompress the .zip file. This will create a new directory containing the McIDAS-V source and Unidata IDV .jar files.
The resulting directory structure will be:
mc-v/ mc-v/build.xml mc-v/... <-- McIDAS-V source directories idv/ idv/lib <-- Unidata IDV
.jar files
The Ant build script "mc-v/build.xml" is be used to build and run McIDAS-V.
3. Change to the mc-v directory and run:
"ant jar" to create the McIDAS-V .jar files in mc-v/dist .
"ant run" to run McIDAS-V with a small java heap size for testing.

Color-filled contours of surface temperature

Mean sea level pressure as a color-shaded image, and contour lines
A plan view is a horizontal display of 2D data on the map, or a horizontal cross-section of 3D data. Conventional contour plots of data on a map
are a plan view.
Plan views can be displayed in several ways:
with solid or dashed contour lines
with contour lines colored by value
with color-filled contours
with "color-shaded" images (all data grid cells colored by value, which may be smoothed)

Colors help distinguish values and subtle features, and if used carefully can be an intuitive indication of value and trend, such as using "hot"
colors for higher or important values.
An McIDAS-V 3D Plan View can be set to any level of the data levels in the data source, or between data levels, in which case interpolation is
used to estimate the data values in the plan view. A colored square selector point in the left corner of the 3D plan view can be moved up and
down by dragging the mouse button to re-position the level. You can make several 3D plan views at the same time, for one or more parameters in
3D data. To learn how to make a display, see Getting Started: Displaying Gridded Data .
You can control the display appearance of plan views with the associated Plan View Control

3D Surface
Isosurfaces
Topography Display
2D Data Draped Over Topography

Isosurfaces
An isosurface is a surface of a single value in a 3D parameter field. Isosurfaces are the 3D analog of a single-valued contour line in a 2D plot.
The intersection of an isosurface and a plane is a contour line of the same value. Isosurfaces may form closed surfaces enclosing regions of higher
or lower value, but not always.

3D Isosurface for 50 m/s wind speed
McIDAS-V also supports isosurface displays that are colored from another parameter, not the parameter used to make the shape of the surface.
The example here shows an isosurface of 89% relative humidity over North America colored by air temperature. A useful plot is to color
isosurfaces by height (geopotential height) to show height of features by color.

Relative Humidity isosurface of 89%, colored by air temperature.

Topography Display
For data sources that include topography or terrain data, such as the "terrain" parameter in Eta and RUC model output or DEM data, McIDAS-V
can display a 3D relief map. Select "Topography" for the display type.

Plan View, Vector Cross Section, Streamline Plan View, and Wind Barb Plan View.

Vector display

Streamline display

Meteorological wind barb display
Starting with vector or wind barb plan displays, you can switch to a streamline display using the wind display Control. Make sure the skip interval
is zero to see the best streamlines. The Control also allows you to change size and color of the vectors and barbs, skip data points to declutter the
display, change the level of plan views, toggle visibility, and remove the display.

Observations
Point Data Displays
Track Displays

Point Data Displays
You can make plots of point data such as meteorological surface (METAR) and synoptic surface weather station observations.

For more information see Getting Started: Displaying Surface and Upper Air Point Data . You can change the plot layout with the Station Model
Editor. You can plot non-meteorological point data as well. The image below depicts the locations of earthquakes, sized by magnitude and colored
by depth.
