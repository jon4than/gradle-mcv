<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<symbols>

<!-- 
This xml allows you to specify new kinds of glyph symbols  in the layout model editor.
These will show up in the drawing editor palette. This xml file (stationsymbols.xml) can
be placed in a plugin or just copied into your ~/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv directory.

(Note: if you are not running the latest nightly build of the IDV (after October 15th, 2008)
then the directory is ~/.metapps/DefaultIdv)

Since we are in the 3D world you can create shapes with a set of lines, a set of triangles  or a set of quadrilaterals.

Each symbol tag contains:

The shapetype can be one of:
line
triangle
quad

The  points attribute is a set of comma separated points (x,y,z) that define
a number of shapes. The number of points is dependent on the shapetype. For
example, the line shapetype defines a set of line segments so you need 2 points
for each line segment.

For triangle shapetype you need 3 points. For quad you need 4.

The scale allows you to set the scale

The icon is just the icon used in the layout model editor

Note: When you are working on creating a symbol you need to restart the IDV every time you change
this file. Also, the layout model you create with a shape defined here will contain the original
points from when you created the layout model. So, you need to delete the shape glyph and re-add it


Note: we don't handle errors very well when instantiating a shape from the xml.
So, if you create a shape in the layout model editor and nothing happens look for a 
stack trace print out.
