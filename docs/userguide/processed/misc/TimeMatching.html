<div class="pagetitle">Time Matching</div>
<p>Time Matching is a feature that allows users to easily create loops of various data with differing temporal frequencies.&nbsp;An example case of where time matching may be useful is if a user wants to create a 4-hour loop of satellite data, and overlay radar data on the satellite images.&nbsp;This data may come in&nbsp;with different frequencies (ex: Satellite data may come in 2 times an hour, while Radar data may come in 8 times an hour). In the past, a user would have to go into the Absolute Times tab of the radar data and individually select every time that matched up with the satellite data. With&nbsp;Time Matching, this is no longer necessary. See the example image below:</p>
<div class="images"><img src="../images/TimeMatching.gif" width="543" height="145" alt="Image 1: Time Matching Example"><br>
<span class="caption">Image 1: Time Matching Example</span></div>
<p>The example above shows the temporal frequency that Satellite and Radar images come in (each image is marked by an 'X').&nbsp;In this example, the Satellite data is set as the driver, and Radar data is set to match the driver. When using Time Matching, McIDAS-V will look at the times of the satellite image,&nbsp;and pick out the radar images that matches up most closely with each satellite image. This radar time may be earlier or later than the satellite time. In this example, only the satellite and radar times contained in the rectangles are used in the display. Therefore, every satellite image is displayed, but only every fourth radar image is displayed.</p>
<p>Time Matching can be used with a variety of types of data, including Satellite, Radar, Grid, and Point data. In general, the item with the lowest temporal frequency will be set as the &quot;time driver&quot;, while other items will be set to match the times of the driver.</p>
<p>The time driver can also be set in the Time Animation Widget.&nbsp;There is an option in&nbsp;the <strong>Define Animation Times</strong> tab called <strong>Set as Time Driver</strong>. This feature allows a user to set a block of times to be a driver before loading any data. For example, a time animation over the last 5 hours in 30 minute increments can be set up, this can be set as the driver, and layers chosen to match time driver times will match the Time Animation Widget times.</p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Methods of Setting the Time Driver</div>
<ul class="propertylist">
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Field Selector -</strong> In the <strong>Times</strong> tab of the <strong>Field Selector</strong>, use the dropdown menu to choose <strong>Set As Time Driver</strong>.  Once Create Display is clicked, the data will display, and this field will now be set as the time driver.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Layer Controls -</strong> If the <strong>Field Selector</strong> method above wasn't used, after creating the display, use the <strong>View-&gt;Times-&gt;Drive Times with this Display</strong> menu item in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong>. After this option is chosen, the layer will be set as the time driver.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Methods of Matching the Time Driver</div>
<ul class="propertylist">
<p>Note that it is only possible to match time driver times if a time driver has already been set in the session. Most data sources that support time matching have the options listed below. However, not all data sources have the option of matching the time driver in all three tabs. For example, with the Gridded Data data source, there is no option to match time driver times in the <strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Data Explorer.</p>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Data Sources -</strong> In the <strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Data Explorer, at the bottom of the <strong>Times</strong> panel, choose the <strong>Match Time Driver</strong> checkbox. This will gray-out the <strong>Times</strong> panel, and clicking <strong>Add Source</strong> will add times for the layer that match closest to the time driver times.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Field Selector -</strong> If the <strong>Data Sources</strong> method above wasn't used, in the <strong>Times</strong> tab of the <strong>Field Selector</strong>, use the dropdown menu to choose <strong>Match Time Driver</strong>.  Once Create Display is clicked, the only times of data that will display are those that match closest to the time driver times.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Layer Controls -</strong> If the <strong>Data Sources</strong> or <strong>Field Selector</strong> methods above weren't used, after creating the display, use the <strong>View-&gt;Times-&gt;Uses Time Driver Times</strong> menu item in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong>. After this option is chosen, the data must be reloaded. To do this, use the <strong>File-&gt;Reload Data</strong> menu item in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong>. Once this is done, the data will reload, and only use the times that match closest to the time driver times.</li>
</ul>
    <div class="pagesubtitle">Terminology</div>
<ul class="propertylist">
<li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Time Driver -</strong> Sets the times that will be used in the display. This is generally the item with the lowest temporal frequency that sets the times other items will use in the display. The time driver must be set in order to use Time Matching. A layer can be set to be a time driver in the <strong>Field Selector</strong> tab or in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong> tab of the Data Explorer.</li>
<li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Match Time Driver -</strong> Follows the times set by the time driver. This is generally an item with a higher temporal frequency than the time driver. McIDAS-V will select the times of these items to use in the loop based off of what the time steps of the time driver are. In general, a layer can be set to match the time driver in the <strong>Data Sources</strong>, <strong>Field Selector</strong>, or <strong>Layer Controls</strong> tab of the Data Explorer.</li>
