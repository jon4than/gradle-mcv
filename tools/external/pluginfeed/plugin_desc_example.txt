# NOTES:
# Plugin description files support commented lines. Do note that 
# a line such as "title=Title here # bluh duh" will NOT work like you
# want! Also note that empty lines are not supported.
# 
# Plugins may share the same title attribute. It is assumed that if two
# plugins have the same title and category these plugins are merely different
# versions, like say versions 1 and 2.
title=This is the name that'll appear within the plugin manager.
# This is the name of the file containing the plugin. The actual path to
# this file is formed in plugins.py by simply concatenating the 
# PLUGIN_DIRECTORY global variable with (in this case) "example.jar".
# Do note that the value of the "version" attribute should be included in
# the file name.
link=example-1.jar
# This can be as long as you like, but please keep everything on one line.
description=This describes what the plugin does
# This attribute determines the category to which our plugin belongs.
category=Examples
# The version number of this plugin. This value must always be specified.
# Newer versions of a plugin should have a larger version number than previous
# versions. Only integers are allowed for a version number (sorry!).
version=1
