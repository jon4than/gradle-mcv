This file is intended to be a place to keep Ant experiments that may not be 
ready for other people to try.

All changes to official builds and whatnot will happen in build.xml.

Ant will use "build.xml" unless you tell it otherwise:
  ant -f build-customized.xml info

Creating a shell alias to do the above is recommended!

You can tell Git to ignore any changes to this file by running:
  git update-index --assume-unchanged build-customized.xml

And you can re-enable change tracking by running:
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged build-customized.xml
        </echo>
    </target>
